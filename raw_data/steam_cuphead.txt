That being said it's the best $20 I've spent in a while. Fluid gameplay, pleasing art style, good soundtrack, and general creativity come together to bring Cuphead.
Student123	Recommended	43.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Student123/	Paid full price for this game on steam and i am glad i did not skip over this. After hearing a lot of things about this game i decided to look into it. This game is quite challenging but it makes you want to continue playing and see what is next even if you have to do it over and over again. The control is pretty good and you move well even with a mouse and keyboard. I beat the game using mouse and keyboard, a controller is not necessary but it probably might make the game slightly easier or a lot. I was able to beat Expert Mode with a Keyboard so for people who just want to use keyboard, it is doable.The music is great and fit the game beautifully. The design of the bosses and worlds really does make the game stand out.  I don't write reviews much but i did it because this game really deserve recognition. Also i needed to write a review for the steam awards badge. I am a casual badge collector, I like badges. I just collect them casually.

Myopic Void	Recommended	26.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IntoTheUnfathomedTower/	Been playing platformers since Apogee era games in the early 90's and have to say that this is among one of my favourite games out of the entire genre. Cuphead isn't just a masterpiece in terms of its artistic, audio and visual work, the games design and gameplay shines just as much as those do. The games art style is a tribute to 1930's cartoons and the gameplay mechanics are a mish-mash of 90's shoot-em-up side scrollers such as Contra, Metal Slug and Gunstar Heros (more so the latter) and though there are a few 'Run and Gun' levels which involve platforming, collecting coins, shooting/avoiding enemies until you reach the end of the level, the games main focus is on boss fights, each being very unique from the last. The game itself is not easy either although I wouldn't say it's as hard as a lot of people make it out to be, it is very forgiving seeing as you're able to retry bosses/levels at your own leisure rather than getting slapped with a gameover screen after your continues are depleted. The fights are completely fair too, although punishing should you lose concentration and mistime a dodge or not memorize the way certain attacks work and repeat the same mistakes over and over again until even the announcer begins to sound bored of announcing the start of battles. The audio/soundtrack is incredibly well done, all original music composed for this game sound in place for a 30's cartoon as do the sound effects.Meticulous effort went into every aspect of this games design, it was hard to wipe a smile off my face while playing it, although a few bosses came close to achieving that. Beyond having a great time with this game, what's even more great is that something like this exists in this era of gaming aswell being a critical and commercial success, it gives me hope for the future of this industry. For newcomers, don't be intimidated by people complaining that it's too hard, it really isn't, each fight is fair and although admittedly some bosses for me almost took the same amount of time to defeat that others took to complete the entire game, the joy of overcoming a challenge was monumentally satisfying. Highly recommended game and deserves every bit of the praise it has recieved. Looking forward to seeing what this developer delivers in the future as there was no lack of effort put into the creation of this game.
KillingArts	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KillingArts/	I’ve been waiting for Cuphead since it was first revealed in 2014. Now it’s finally here. Cuphead, a super difficult platformer/run & gun game with outstanding visuals, one which mimics the aesthetics of 1930s cartoons to perfection. The game is pretty, but we knew that for the last 3 years. But is the gameplay any good?Cuphead is basically a series of boss fights with the occasional run & gun level in between, all accessible via an explorable map. It was originally designed as a purely boss fights game, but when it got a lot of attention at the 2014 E3, StudioMDHR decided to make something bigger and better. And I, for one, am glad they did. Nothing in the game feels as if it was just an afterthought. Every boss and every level is well thought out and just feels great.If you look at the screenshots, I’m sure you will agree they are absolutely stunning. The game doesn’t just look similar to 1930s animations. It looks exactly like it. Not only is it drawn perfectly, it also mimics the animations spot on. Combined with a nice filter that simulates the flickering of an old film, the illusion is complete, you really feel like you are in an old cartoon.The sound is equally convincing. The game plays an original song on the title screen and right away it feels like this is a very authentic re-imagination of the cartoons of yore. A style that extends not only in regards to the visuals but also the audio. All sound effects, music and voices sound like they were taken directly from an old film reel.But how does it play? Responsive controls are very important for this type of game. And they are. Responsive that is.. You have just a few actions, the basic movement itself, a dash move, standard and special attack and a movement lock which keeps Cuphead in place while shooting. Aside from that you can switch through your available weapons, while in the air combat missions you also have the ability to hold down a button in order to morph into a smaller version of yourself that is more agile, just doing lesser damage. That’s as far as the controls go. The game is not about complexity. Quite the opposite. You have a very limited set of moves but need to execute them perfectly in order to succeed. If you die in a level, it’s most likely your own fault.You may already have heard that Cuphead is supposed to be quite difficult. Indeed, it is. Both the bosses and the run & gun levels are extremely challenging. Sometimes so challenging that it took me 20 or more tries to get it done. So, don’t let yourself be fooled by the kiddy graphics, this game is hard and you will get bogged down on certain stages. If you don’t enjoy fighting a boss over and over just to get a little better every time until you eventually beat him, just barely, better think twice before getting Cuphead. As brilliant as the game is – it is certainly not for everyone. It might look mainstream and even childish when looking at the screenshots, but the reality is that it is a niche title for a niche audience. It is fast, pure and unforgiving. It won’t hold your hand, it won’t help you on the way. However if you can handle the difficulty, you will enjoy Cuphead a great deal. Nothing is more satisfying than beating a boss that you really got stuck on for the last hour.Cuphead is the game we were all hoping for. The presentation is unique and nearly perfect in both video and audio. The gameplay is simple and precise. It is challenging and addictive, I suffered from ‘just one more try’ syndrome quite a bit. For those who don’t mind challenge and brutal difficulty, it is nearly perfect with very few things to criticize. It may be a simple game, but what it does it does extremely well. If you are even remotely interested in this kind of game and don’t mind the difficulty this is a must-buy.+ Gorgeous Visuals: A beautiful re-imagination of 1930s cartoons, they couldn’t have done it better.+ Sound Design: Music, sound effects and speech all feel very authentic.+ Boss Design: Every boss fight is different in both, the look, and mechanics.* Difficulty: A welcome challenge to some, but a deal breaker to many others.- Hectic Gameplay: You have so much to dodge on the screen and the game is so unforgiving that you don’t have the time to admire the beautiful art style.5/5CHECK OUT THE FULL REVIEW: http://pixeljudge.com/reviews/cuphead/ 
William Shakesman	Recommended	21.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/	Cuphead is Contra. Granted, a Contra with only two proper levels per world and a half dozen nasty bosses, but it's Contra.The 30s/40s cartoon aesthetic is on point without a hint of modern cynicism or faux-retro nonsense. It's a beautiful, charming game in every sense.It is HARD though. Because you have infinite retries and the level select goes straight to the boss or level, the game takes the liberty to make the bosses tough, elaborate affairs. We're talking Ys levels of boss design. After world 1, you should expect to be clocking anywhere from 10-40 deaths just to get a handle on them. They're all tough, imaginative, and fun. Most of the deaths are pretty fair, though there are some pattern combos that the bosses can do that ring a little BS to me, but because death is such a small penalty, it's hard to get that mad.Cuphead understands everything it is referencing on a fundamental level, from the classic cartoons to the classic game design, this game really is as good as it looks.

Seriously, I don't even think that there can be any cons towards this game, unless you dislike old-stylish cartoons and games that take a lot of time to progress through.
PhantasosK	Recommended	10.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040569720/	Cuphead seems to be perfect from every possible aspect.

{ A$ } Q	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentqeutigenmutigenlulligen/	 This review is written with the reference of KONAMI's classical side scrolling run-n-gun shooter Contra released in 1987 (on NES platform, in Europe and other countries it was called Gryzor. Here's a video if you haven't heard of it before), as so many features and unique aspects of this game remind me of the classic Contra. Note: The review is spoiler-free, written based on keyboard and singleplayer gameplay. Table below for quick check, scroll down further for detailed pros and cons. :)  Aspects Score out of 10 Details Aesthetics 10 Breathtakingly stunning hand-drawn world accompanied by watercolor background, original to 1930's Disney cartoon style! Run-n-Gun Levels Design 9 Fast-paced and smooth at its best, except maybe 1/2 bugs that you might or might not even encounter in the whole world for the enemy to be invulnerable to your attacks. Boss Battles Design 10 Every single boss in the game has their own unique attack and patterns, highly distinguishable and consistent! Characters' Design 10 Every character, every enemy species in this game has their own facial expression and personality! Not to mention bosses, oh hell yes..! Control with Keyboard 8 For a game designed for controllers, you'll be surprised how intuitive and smooth the keyboard control can be, though no designated assignable keys for corner-cutting shooting (like top right, bottom right, etc) In-game Soundtrack 10 Encouraging jazz that brings the whole game to life and more importantly, your spirit (pun intended) back to the battle every time you restart! Replayability 10 You guessed it right, the reason why it gets a 10 is because how many times you have to replay the level just to get that perfect run. Don't expect any less! Difficulty for Grasping 8 It might take you a while, and during that time, you will curse a lot. The gameplay in general is very intuitive yet a test of pattern-learning and most of all, reflex. Story 9 Like anyone would really care how the story's like in this genre of games. But seriously, you still do even if most of the time it's being executed and laid out by the run-n-guns and boss battles. The story in Cuphead makes sense! Just the way it should be for this type of genre, very sweet, although slightly short. Overall 9.5  A Must-Have. As other reviews already said, IF you enjoy a good challenge. (And love its retro cartoon-style design)Whoa ho ho! Cuphead.. I picked up this game the moment when I heard that it feels just like the classic Contra run-n-gun shooting. But in perfect 1930's Disney cartoon style!! Where else can you ever find another like this?! So here I go, became cuphead boy dressed in red (or mugman in blue if you play local co-op with your partner), shooting magical droplets out of my bare fingertip, bashing in an "Alice in Wonderland" style cruel little damned island.I used to stay up all night beating Contra with my dad when I just started primary school, this game for what it is, went immediately into my collection. Where should I even start?! For a game developing team that's made of 3 people, after 3 years of development, they've really made sure that almost every aspect of the game, for its own genre, is done RIGHT.   The Pros   Aesthetics: Its eye-catching retro, colorful cartoon style for this genre, makes this game in this apsect, one of its own kind. They decided to stick to the original 1930's Disney cartoon style, by using exactly the same technique used for Disney cartoons to create the entire Cuphead universe -- the result? You got the jaw-dropping, stunningly good-looking boss battle run-n-gun shooting game as it is!  The run-n-gun levels, even if they were made after boss battles, still deliver what it should have: a smooth, intuitive and fast paced shooting experience, hell even the angry flowers have the similar AI pattern to dodge jumping from the cliff like those busboys in the classical Contra, for this type of genre, such detail really shows up how much they've dedicated in the game development to make it feels just right. The boss battle designs do NOT disappoint! Every single boss has their own unique attacks and patterns, making the whole boss battle experience feels so fresh and rewarding when you just want to beat up the previous so to see what the next boss looks like! Bosses taunt you, scorn you and tease you everytime you die, or even during the battle, makes your revenge victory even more rewarding! The character designs are what truly makes this game worth every penny and makes the whole game feels alive and vibrant: from the loading screen bouncy hour glass, to the angry flowers that chase you around and bosses,  EVERYTHING  is vividly alive, and having their own personalities: angry, sad, mad, mean, etc all shown up on their faces. Their FACES! Every enemy in Cuphead encourages you to just shoot-em-up without hesitation. This is how such genre of games should be! The in-game soundtrack is so much more important than one might think for this type of games: if it's bad or repetitive, it directly affects the battles and making the game unenjoyable FAST. This is also why this game is so good in this aspect because the music is SO GOOD! The cheerful jazz is so well composed, even if you die from the battle, you still feel you can do it next time, thanks to the soundtrack of the game. Similar to Contra who also has great background music that suits every stage of the fight, Cuphead inherited the good music tradition to be able to deliver a hardcore shoot-em-up in such classy and classical way!   The Cons  Keyboard control, even if feels surprisingly smooth and intuitive for its own right, is not optimal for this game: no designated keys for corner-cutting aiming, which means you have to hold down 2 keys to do that in the game, for a fast-paced shoot-em-up like this? You can still do it, but might not be as good as using controller. At least to me.  Loads of cursing and frustration, accompanied by re-playing the same level (if this is a huge downside to you and affects you a lot, don't buy the game). Lacking of online co-op.>>>Update<<<Here's something I almost forgot to mention:For every game section in Cuphead, there are Two difficulty settings for you to choose from: Simple and Regular. By default, the game will always run on the Regular difficulty unless you select Simple otherwise. Simple mode excludes your ability to fight certain bosses whom you can access in Regular mode. So it's completely up to the player which difficulty they want to beat the game on..   Conclusion  For such quality of art design, character design and battle design, if you enjoy dying your way to perfection, this game is for you. You're prolly gonna die a lot, but if you don't mind such means to achieve faster reflex and having sense of great achievement in having perfect runs (even with your partner!), then go grab this game NOW.
Emperor Gandhi	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/	Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.Hoo boy, so let's take some time to talk about Cuphead.I've been looking forward to this game since its reveal at E3 back in 2014. As time progressed, I found myself losing interest in the game despite the obviously awesome visuals, but nothing really stood out to me. But it came out, and people were calling it one of "the best indie games ever made", among other things. And as someone who loves to support passionate indie developers like these guys, I knew I had to give the game a shot. And after ~17 hours of sweating uncontrollably and shouting profanities every five seconds of playing, I finally took down the final boss. I had a hard time gathering my thoughts for this game, and while I absolutely love most of it, I can't help but feel like this game is a little overrated. Okay, please, don't lynch me yet.GraphicsDo I really need to talk about the visuals? It's one of the main selling points of the game, and of course it's gorgeous. The attention to detail is staggering, and even in the smallest things (for example, as pointed out by The Completionist, some NPCs in the overworld will turn their head in your direction regardless of where you're at) you can really see that the artists ensured that every aspect of this game is top-notch visually. One thing I love about the visuals in particular are the variety in the boss designs. Some, like Satan and Wally Warbles utilize very basic designs, but are an incredibly versatile and allow for some really creative animation ideas. For example, the former can take his head and turn it into a serpent or a spider, both of which are transitioned into seamlessly. Hell, upon further thought, I'd even be willing to argue that this is one of the best looking games of all time, just because of how impressive the animation is. But this is a review, not a debate, and I DID say I felt this game was overrated for a reason. Thankfully, that reason isn't the graphics...Gameplay...but instead the gameplay. I know, I know. How DARE I criticize one of the so-called "best indie games of all time". That is definitely a justified reason to want to lynch me, apparently. So before you decide to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over me, let me explain what the gameplay does right. First of all, the basic mechanics, like dashing, jumping, moving, and shooting, are all extremely tight and incredibly polished. This is very important for a game like this, where precision is crucial to progressing through the game. I also really enjoy the variety in the bosses from a gameplay standpoint, as many have completely different attacks to learn, testing you in every way. Some, like the Phantom Express, have a big emphasis on mastering parrying. Dr. Kahl's Robot is a big final test of your mastery of the plane segments. Beppi the Clown is probably the game's rite of passage, as it tests your patience more than any other boss up to that point. The mausoleum as well as the run and gun stages are a little lacking, but are still a nice change of pace. So where does it fall flat? Well, that lies in the game's difficulty. HEY, I SAID TO WAIT ON THE LYNCHING. Now, I LOVE games that are difficult. Dark Souls 3 (and Dark Souls 1 to an extent) is one of my all-time favorite games, as well as Super Meat Boy. Now why do I bring these games up? I'm not trying to make myself seem like a "pro gamer" or whatever, because I'm really not. I haven't even beaten Super Meat Boy, truth be told. But these games, while difficult, are FAIR. They give you a task that seems impossible at first, and through repetition and patience, you'll quickly be able to progress forward and be rewarded for that. Cuphead, unfortunately, feels too unfair at many points throughout the game. Why? Because of the game's over-reliance on RNG. I don't care if it's thematic or not, this is a game that's trying to be based around skill, not Hearthstone. Some bosses, like Grim Matchstick and Rumor Honeybottoms require you to jump from platform to platform and avoid falling to your death, but the problem is these platforms are RANDOMLY GENERATED. That means you can (and likely will) die of circumstances way out of your control. Speedrunners tend to restart a fight if the boss they're fighting starts with one of their harder to dodge attacks, most notably with Djimmi the Great. On top of this though, some attacks from bosses have no telegraph for their hardest hitting attacks (Hilda Berg and Cagney Carnation) which means no-hit runs can end due to attacks you had no time to react to. This type of stuff happens A LOT through out the game, and it really did ruin part of the fun for me. However, thankfully, not all bosses suffered from these issues, and the main mechanics are so tight that in some cases you could easily respond to these BS moments. Overall, these poor design choices and overuse of RNG do hurt the game, but not to the point that my experience was completely ruined. I am giving this game a thumbs-up after all, right?StoryThere's not much of a story, to be honest. It's there, but there's so little of it that I can't really evaluate this. I will be omitting this from the scoring.AudioI'm a big fan of jazz music. Especially considering that I am a jazz trombonist, I was right at home with this soundtrack. Everything just works here. Some of the pieces do some really clever stuff, like Railroad Wrath with the horns mimicking train horns and the drum set sounding like a train moving on traintracks, as well as Murine Corps foreshadowing the final phase of the fight by having the saxophones mimic a cat meowing. Also, bonus points for having a real ensemble playing it. Just give it a listen for yourself, because any fans of jazz will adore this game's soundtrack. I also quite love the game's audio design, as it adds to the authenticity of the 1930's vibe they were going for, with the slight static in the background and the barely-audible voice acting. Overall, the sound is incredible in this game, and I will be listening to the soundtrack for many years to come.ReplayabilityCuphead is a pretty short game if you know what you're doing, but there's enough depth in the gameplay to keep you coming back, with an expert mode being unlocked upon completion of the regular game. Thanks to the questionable RNG moments of the game, I'm not quite sure if I'll personally replay this game again, but there's definitely some there for people who really want to master this game.VerdictOverall, Cuphead is a very, very good game. It's definitely not the "best indie game" ever made by any means - it's not even my favorite of 2017. So while it's not amazing, it's a total blast to play if you can power through the weird design choices with some of the bosses. I'd definitely buy it at full price if masochism's your thing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to therapy thanks to the trauma King Dice gave me.Graphics - 10/10Gameplay - 7.5/10Story - NONEAudio - 10/10Replayability - 5.5/10.:8.5/10:."Great"+ Incredibly detailed visual and sound design+ Visually distinct boss fights+ "Authentic" jazzy soundtrack+ Lots of gameplay variety+ Tight mechanics- Poor design choices for numerous bosses gameplay-wise- Over-reliance on RNG
PomPom	Recommended	122.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pominya/	Paying debt to the devil is not an easy feat.Highly recommend for anyone who miss punishing 80s/early 90s run n guns like Contra and Megaman. The 1930s animation style is also amazing to look at with surreal boss designs very similar to Silly Symphony.The controls are very arcadey with 8 directional shooting, single jump, descending platforms and a special attack, but it also adds parrying and dash, which were way less common back then. Parrying is not the same as most games as you can only parry certain pink bullets or enemies done by bouncing off it while in midair (working as a double jump). It does not shoot the projectile back at the boss, but instead gives you one full card for your your super meter, letting you use a special attack for the specified weapon you have equipped or a super attack if you hold 5 cards. You can have two weapons equipped during a level and switch them instantly whenever you want. The weapons in the game are situational enough for that I would switch them around for specific bosses, though the charge shot is currently a little too strong so I used it for almost every boss in expert mode when I found out its strength. But there's still good use for the other weapons, since it doesn't give crowd control like spread shot and boomerang, and lobber (bullets that drop after being shot) and chaser (chases enemies) let you have better positionings on some bosses.Every boss has multiple phases, and are only 1-3 minutes long, but due to everything you gotta dodge all the time without much breaks just one minute can feel waaaaay longer. This is something I felt for Furi as well (another amazing challenging boss rush game I recommend). The boss phase transformations are very surreal and they can go from being a couple battletoads turning into a slot machine or a bird stuck in a bird house to a featherless bird carried in a stretcher spitting up its heart that attacks you. You can choose between fighting them in simple or regular mode. Simple mode gives you linear patterns, while regular they will be random, so you have to be more careful with what the boss will do next. You can only get a contract by playing on regular mode (required to advance the game), but simple mode  is okay for practicing the patterns. The difficulty of the bosses curves really well too. It starts out a little rough, but gets really challenging at the second island, and even more so at the third island. Then the finale after that is a true Satan's work.There are also shoot em up bosses with the same parrying, but instead of dashing it let's you shrink to move faster and dodge projectiles since your hitbox is smaller as well. But it also reduces your range and damage to balance it out.Platforming sections, which were added later in development and got the game delayed are actually pretty good too. They really feel like old arcade platformers. Most platformer levels also have a miniboss at the end, so they're still not bossless (even a Mega Man 2 reference in one of them). The intensity of them are on the same scale as the boss fights, you won't be running around without enemies coming at you from multiple directions. Only thing I thought could be done better is hiding the coins, they're a little too easy to obtain, so most of the challenge is just finishing the stage itself with a good rating. You generally won't have to replay the level just to try and find coins you couldn't. But on the topic of coins, you can find hidden things in the overworld. Some characters will reward you with a coin for doing things for them and there are a few hidden paths granting you a coin or a shortcut to later levels. It's a really nice touch I wasn't even expecting from this type of game.The replayability is also great for with expert mode being unlocked after beating the game and trying to get S rank for every boss. There is also a pacifist rank for platform stages where you have to beat the stage without killing anything, which can be tricky since most stages have midbosses or walls that you need to find ways to skip.I had been waiting for this game for years, and it honestly went beyond my expections. It's definitely one of my favourite games after just 10 hours and hope you all buy it, it's a very rare gem you won't see much of in modern gaming.

VALIS	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VALIS/	Brilliant. Truly brilliant.Gameplay-wise, it reminds me quite a bit of 8 and 16-bit era platformers like Contra and Super Contra, Gunstar Heroes, or a sped-up Mega Man. The only way to win is to practice, and learn, and get better. Learn how the bosses move, learn when you're safe to move, and learn the entire sequence of the boss battle. It's difficult but very compelling -- you want to try again right away, because, ah ha, now I figured out his pattern! But the boss stages have multiple "waves," so you don't learn their one trick and it's over. You have to remember the tricks to each wave of the boss stage. It's the perfect balance between challenging and frustrating. You can do it, you'll just have a good number of fun, failed attempts along the way.If Cuphead were just about the gameplay, it would be a solid title but not exactly groundbreaking. But that art. Oh my god, that art. I was already a huge fan of old cartoons from Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, Disney, and others, so even if Cuphead made a mediocre attempt at the style, I would have loved it. But I'm thrilled to say the art style, the humor, the little touches here and there: PERFECT. The game is a visual delight, and it's not just the style that's compelling, it's the black humor throughout, like characters shooting Craps in an empty coffin. It's like the bleakest Betty Boop or Porky Pig cartoon, where every animal, vegetable, and mineral is an anthropomorphic nightmare.While Cuphead is a combination of 1980s platform gameplay and 1930s cartoon stylings, it feels like one of the freshest experiences I've had gaming in quite a while. Very warmly recommended.

TheColorUrple	Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/	Concerning the difficulty.I bought a cute little mini Super Nintendo recently and have been working my way through both Super Castlevania IV and Contra 3.Those adorable little Super Nintendo games are ♥♥♥♥ing hard as ♥♥♥♥. Much harder than Cuphead.Cuphead borrows many of the design philosophies that govern those older games, but really rounds off the edges in various ways to make it a much more entertaining and forgiving experience.Cuphead demands that you learn tells and find the best way to survive attacks, oftentimes needing to split your attention between two or three different on-screen threats and rapidly navigate them into constantly-moving safe zones. But the tells are obvious and getting into the right position isn't too tough.Despite a difficult-to-master parry move, Cuphead also feels perfect to control (once you remap the buttons....see my guide). Those older Super Nintendo characters control like bricks in comparison.You also get a pretty sizable arsenal of weapons and perks, which can be changed for every encounter. I found that each of the weapons had their moment of being the most useful against a particular boss, so much of the difficulty can be eliminated once you figure out the best weapons to use.Thankfully, each level only takes 2 minutes to beat, so instantly restarting to try again doesn't feel too punishing or frustrating. (One end-game Cuphead battle is the exception to this - expect to grind through a 5-minute run before attempting the boss' hard-as-nails final form.)Cuphead's most important old-school design quirk is the inherent randomness to on-screen attacks, which give the game both its highest highs and lowest lows.On the plus side, you can never truly memorize any sort of attack pattern and rinse and repeat the same strategy to win. Cuphead requires you to stay on your feet, reacting on the go since attack patterns are randomized and always thrown together with different timings.This makes Cuphead endlessly entertaining, but it also comes with a serious caveat. The randomness at play means you will often get trapped among attacks that are impossible to avoid. No, this is not a simple case of git gud; it is legitimately unfair and will put you in inescapable death traps quite frequently. You *can* and *will* improve though, and good players should be able to consistently kill bosses on most runs. Getting a perfect score, however, which evaluates your time, health, parries, and special moves, is another matter entirely.Super Castlevania IV and Contra 3 both feature this randomness - getting impossibly cornered by a boss is par for the course, and it's basically how most side-scrolling games were designed at the time. But these games are significantly harder because you have to progress through much longer sections of the game to reattempt whatever killed you, and the controls just don't feel good by today's standards.Cuphead is a one-hour game that will take you around 8-12 hours to finish, unless you go for high scores and achievements (I got my 100% achievement completion at the 17-hour mark). This was the same way in the olden days - if you paid $70 for a one-hour game, you would feel cheated, so the difficulty was a way to keep players invested. Cuphead is more than worth your investment, even at full price. It's a fantastic game.
Jinium	Recommended	29.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jinium/	I'm Asian and I've never opened my eyes so damn wide.Cuphead is a game where you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings. There's a lot going on on-screen, and it tests your focusing abilities, and also your reflexes on how quick you react (or dodge) danger. Without doubt, this game is really difficult even on normal mode (let's be honest here, even normal is tough. Don't give me that "You never tried hard mode then" crap). You get a really satisfying feeling from completing each boss. Though sometimes you might feel like it's unfair that you lost, most of the times you hate yourself for making a silly mistake every time you replay a boss, and that's what makes me smash that replay button every time I did a silly mistake.This game, 10/10 with an amazing artwork. I'm glad I managed to finish the game.
TheTitaniumDragon	Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/	Cuphead is a punishingly hard 2D platformer run and gun/shmup styled after cartoons from the early 1930s. Lovingly hand-drawn, this game is extremely stylish; the whole thing recalls cartoons of the 1930s, from the audio to the visuals to the fonts to the characters in the game. Every bit of this game is bursting with 1930s style; unlike “retro” video games, this is genuinely a game intended to look as if it was made in the 1930s.At its core, Cuphead is a boss rush game. Most of the levels in the game take the form of some sort of multi-stage boss, which transforms itself into new forms as you fight your way through. There are no hit point indicators in this during the course of a match; you simply have to beat on the boss until it transforms into its next stage, with your hits only registering as brief flashes on the boss to indicate that your attack had indeed scored.This gives the game a rather intimidating aesthetic, as the bosses are not easy; the game starts off with a couple of fairly simple bosses, but rapidly ramps up to much more difficult fare. By the end of the first world, you’ll be fighting bosses harder than what you see in most 2D platformer games; by the end of the second world, things are even harder.But you will persevere; the game, while very difficult, also is designed to help you predict the enemy movements, which, while somewhat randomized, are telegraphed (albeit without much time to react in some cases) and can all be dodged. Every level can be beaten without taking a hit – and you’d better get good at dodging, as you only have three hit points.The bosses operate on 1930s cartoon logic as well, and often involve both pun names and visual puns. The enemies change their attack patterns and often undergo physical transformations – often wild ones – as you fight your way through them. Unlike modern children’s cartoons, at times these could be fairly dark, and the bosses become increasingly intimidating in many cases as the game goes on, while simultaneously often maintaining their comedic air and recalling ideas from the early 20th century like mysticism, hypnotism, and old school circuses and amusement parks.The game’s core gameplay is pretty simple – you can move around, angle the cursor to shoot at angles (including downwards), crouch and shoot, do an aerial dash, and “parry” pink objects, which absorbs them, bounces your character upwards, and charges your super meter. There are five stages to the super meter, and you have both a basic “super” attack which deals some extra damage and goes through enemies, and a more powerful one that consumes all five super meter stages and gives you a devastating super attack that can chew off about half of a boss stage’s hit points, makes you invincible, or boosts your attack power.In addition to the boss stages, there are a relatively small number (about 2 per world) of levels that consist of running through a stage beating a series of enemies in a more standard side-scrolling type game. These levels themselves can be fairly challenging (though they’re generally breathers compared to the bosses) and they help mix up the gameplay by incorporating more standard 2D platformer elements.There are also five or six shmup bosses in the game in the game, where Cuphead is in an airplane fighting against a flying boss. These levels tend to be by far the hardest in the game; you cannot customize the plane’s weapons, which are a preset pair, and the bosses themselves veer into bullet hell territory, as projectiles often fill the screen save for a relatively narrow path. While some of the 2D platformer levels occaisionally have a lot of projectiles, it is the norm for many of the bosses, and oftentimes, these projectiles are a mixture of multiple kinds of projectile, each with their own path, which makes dodging them significantly more challenging – especially given that there are sometimes four different ways in which they can be combined in a single stage of a boss, and which one comes up is the luck of the draw. It is here that the game can feel the most unfair, and the very last of these – a medusa mermaid – is likely the hardest boss in the game, and her attack patterns can feel almost unavoidable at times.Between the stages, you walk around in a “world map” type thing, where you can interact with a small number of NPCs, who will sometimes challenge you to do things and reward you with a coin, or going to the shop, where you can spend coins to buy new options for your characters. Some are new attack options – such as tracking shots that deal less damage, or the ability to charge up shots like Megaman at the cost of not being able to hold down the button to fire continuously – while others enhance your character in other ways, such as making you invincible during a dash, giving you an extra hit point at the cost of dealing less damage, or automatically parrying when you jump.This game is fun, but not in the same way that something like Portal 2 is fun. Rather, this is a game which is fun because of its challenge and because the aesthetic pairs nicely with the gameplay. You are going to die if you play Cuphead. You are, in fact, going to die many hundreds of times before you get to the end and win your soul back from the Devil (gambling is bad, kids!). If you don’t like hard games – if you don’t like failing many times while learning the bosses patterns, so that you can finally succeed – you won’t like this game, as repeated deaths while learning the boss patterns is all but inevitable on all but the very easiest stages.If you like the idea of working hard to overcome a series of difficult mechanical challenges, this game is likely right up your alley. And while the game is hard, it is ultimately fair in its difficulty. The charm of the game helps to make the challenge feel less miserable, and the fact that there is a constant goal hovering ahead of you, pulling you forward, makes it feel like you are, in fact, making progress, no matter how many times you fail. Overcoming the bosses feels really good, and after you beat them, it is remarkable how much easier they are to beat again for a better score. It is remarkable how much better you get at this game simply by playing it, and while it is quite the gauntlet, when you’re done with it, you’ll feel like you’ve earned your victory.

DoubleDee	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DoubleDeeYT/	Cuphead, a silly little Game from an widely unknown Developer. It's "sub"Genre could be put into the Bossrun segment, but oh Boy that is not all, keep reading and I will try convey everything what is, in my opinion, making Cuphead the best "retro-bossrun-shoot'em up" of 2017!First thing I heard about Cuphead, Game reviewers saying "omg rofllol, new darksouls, tutorial unbeatable", and afterwards bought it because... well, who doesn't love a Challenge?Immediately after starting up the game: The most beautiful music, it really brings out the Ambience in each and every Stage of the Game. Just beautiful.The Graphics are really amazing, that must've been a LOT of work, every Animation is handdrawn! Such commitment must be praised!Straight foreward old-school 2D run and gun Game, even with a little "collect Coins to get Weapons" Segment.For an old dog the first few Hours of Gameplay were a Cakewalk, but the difficulty rises, with each Boss having more and more Actions that you need to learn, adapt and overcome.The Bosses range from simple Vegetable to Trains, Rollercoasters and Dragons. (ugh the pain)I'll keep it short: If you want a little ragy Game that puts your Platforming skills to the test, this Game will definetly answer.Great Game, had a lot of fun, frustrating and raging Moments with it, which are now eternally embeded on my Youtube Channel.Thank you for reading. If you found this helpful, please give this review a Thumbs up, that would really help me out!
Ғђ ▫Suicide's littlehelper	Recommended	19.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/smallsuicide/	I'm currently banging my head against the key board as I enter my 352nd death... I believe Cuphead is actually a lot harder than Dark Souls and I still find this game a lot of fun. Cuphead has amazing, innovative while also nostalgic, visual style. The game ships complete. There are no Season Pass or DLC announcements, which means they're not cutting content out just to squeeze more money out of gamers. It's a minimalistic story that doesn't interfere with the gameplay. It's a game, not a movie, yet it manages to feel like both. Unlike those games that try to be "cinematic" and end up half-assing both sides. No preposterous DRM and still manages to sell more on PC. Gameplay is not innovative, but it's not lazy. It's well crafted and executed. It's hard but not unfair. There are no micro transactions, loot boxes or any other way to make customers keep paying for something they've already bought.It's almost as if respecting your customers is not altogether a terrible idea! I recommend Cuphead whole heartedly. Happy gaming!
Nickervision	Recommended	2.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nickervision/	What an absolutely astonishingly beautiful game. Plays great, quite difficult, but man oh man, the visuals will just blow you away.
lightningwater27	Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lightningwater27/	This game single handedly renewed my faith in video games.    Worth every single penny on the visuals alone.
RipWitch	Recommended	58.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitchUniverse/	Look, we can skip all the fighting if you would just give me the contract.If you ever needed a reason not to gamble, come here and go through the story of Cuphead and Mugman. Against the wishes of their caretaker, the boys decide to visit the Devil’s Casino and manage to get a winning streak. However, they caught the Devil’s attention and the bet is raised; if they win the casino is theirs, but if they lose the Devil will own their soul. To their dismay, they lose, but the Devil decides to strike them a deal the boys couldn't refuse. The Devil will let them keep their souls if they collect all the soul contracts of other debtors. With three worlds to go through, Cuphead (and Mugman if in co-op) has a lot of work to do.There are two different types of stages, Run and Gun and Bosses. Each world, has two Run and Gun stages which has you running through a side-scrolling stage occasionally gunning your way through or perhaps dodging to be a Pacifist. These stages may not be bosses, but they do have their fair share of difficulty. While completing Run and Gun stages optional, only needing to get the contracts to proceed, it’s your main source of coins other than finding them hidden in the worlds. These coins will allow you to buy the various upgrades that would ultimately help you on your journey. And with all the bosses varying in their approach, both between each other and in their own phases, just having the basic weapon will just make it harder.The upgrades, while helpful, each have their advantages and disadvantages. For weapons, this means how far it goes, how much damage, and their path that it takes. If a boss has a phase that takes part on the bottom of the screen with platforms above, you might want to bring in the Lobber, which has the downwards path but is slow firing. Have difficulty aiming while dodging? Equip the Chaser, which homes onto the boss at the cost of lower damage (and possibly other enemies confusing it). You can also buy charms, or passive abilities, that gives Cuphead an advantage such as a small invincibility window when dashing or one auto-parry per jump.The vast majority of Cuphead is the bosses who are (mostly) the debtors. All the bosses are unique and have at least three phases, all of which switches up the boss’s attack or adds more onto it. Mixing and matching your loadout is best, as some weapons may or may not work well with some bosses and you can switch out your charm or super art to accommodate your weaknesses. However, this will not exactly make the boss easier. Each boss has their own patterns that are choreographed and apart from the first couple tries to learn the boss, getting hurt is your own fault. With Cuphead’s controls being responsive, most damage you will take will not be because the game decided to not respond to your button presses. There are some randomized parts, but you can clearly can still tell what is coming. React accordingly and you are destined to win.You don’t just dodge attacks, there are some that you can parry that is shown by the pink coloring. Each parry, with some exceptions, charges a full card on your super meter were it would usually be slowly filled by landing hits. Charging the cards lets you do EX attacks or Super Arts. The EX attacks (costing one card) is different depending on what weapon is equipped and deals more damage than the usual attack. Super Arts, however, is granted by completing Mausoleums, cost a full super meter, and can either deal a ton of damage or grant temporary invincibility if you get into a rough spot. Just make sure you equip what you need. Getting parries and using your super meter will raise your grade on the stage card as getting under a certain time and not being hit as much will not cut it.It is no secret that the visuals are absolutely amazing. They totally captured the look of 1930’s cartoons and you can tell how much they put into every background and character. You can clearly tell where you are, discern what is background and what is projectiles, and see upcoming threats if they appear in the background first. The jazzy soundtrack is great and ties in with their corresponding bosses easily while also not being annoying after multiple replays. Despite how many times I retried a boss, I never got tired of the music nor art, just my inability to not get hit despite knowing the attacks. Just admit defeat, I was right on top of the end flag when I failed.There are a few things that I wished was put in/not a problem. I found that sometimes parrying is inconsistent and won’t register when I press the button to parry. Even worse, when I have the charm to auto-parry when jumping, I would take damage while also getting the super meter charged. The RNG can easily go against you in the few bosses it is a problem in, just as an attack forcing you to one side at the same time a background attack is coming forward or not getting enough parries. The foreground can also hide projectiles that can just blindside you. Lastly, I do wish there was a way to switch between Cuphead and Mugman, especially when the story focuses on both of them. Give poor Cuphead a break and let Mugman get tagged in.VerdictI honestly liked Cuphead more than I thought I would. Getting it on a whim, I just wanted to check it out and suddenly I went on a journey of constantly dying, winning, then dying all over again. I did take breaks when I got into a rough spot, but I had fun and felt a sense of accomplishment when each boss was defeated. I even went as far as completing it again in Expert mode, which just makes the projectiles faster and changes some patterns. Cuphead certainly is a hard game and if you’re up for the challenge, consider picking it up.
Lintire	Recommended	36.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/	Open your cutlery drawers! Rebel against the reign of forks, spoons, muffins and dice against the noble cup. This is Cuphead, and finally the cup is fighting back. "WELL CUPHEAD AND HIS PAL MUGMAN, THEY LIKE TO ROLL THE DICE"- Every time. Every single ♥♥♥♥ing time you start the game.I S-Ranked every stage in Cuphead. I don't particularly recommend doing this since S-Rank obviously just stands for Stank, but if you don't mind being stinky then it does push the game to its limits.Most of the time it holds up. Sometimes it breaks. Cuphead, for the 0.5 people left that haven't seen or heard about it, is a run and gun shooter where you take on 19 bosses and 6 platform stages for a wholesome, neat total of 25 levels. Most stages only take 2 minutes to complete, and with the game's punishing nature that means it took me about 5 hours to complete the game on regular and 35 hours to push it to its absolute limits. Maybe I'm just terrible. I did S-Rank the game, after all, and stinkiness is inherent to being bad. You might S-Rank it in 20 minutes. If you do, don't tell me. It'd break my heart.Presentation wise, what you're seeing on the storefront is there from beginning to end and then some. The art is intricate, animated with incredible skill and there's not a single aspect I can point to as lazy. Gameplay got the full attention, with cutscenes just being static images, it's hilarious."BY CHANCE THEY CAME UPON DEVIL'S GAME AND GOSH THEY PAID THE PRICE."- Buried in my skull. In my soul. In my heart.OST holds up alongside the art, with jaunty and varied tunes that make the soundtrack worth picking up alongside the game itself. It's committed to aesthetic and puts a melodic ring on that finger.This is a Unity game made by an art-focused studio. It's (mostly) indie. It's heaped coveted praise by the gameplay-focused crowd, which as far as miracles go is up there with witnessing the birth of baby Jesus.Praise that it has earned. Mechanically, first and foremost, this is a polished and fun game with an emphasis on variation. No boss is really like the other and the 90-120 second time on them means that they're shifting through their phases and attacks quickly. As a premium cup of the premium cup drawer, you bring in your own loadout of 2 out of 6 weapons, a super, and 1 of 2 charms! There is technically 6 charms, but 4 are worthless. Stick to coffee and smoke bombs. Also applicable to everyday life. Protip: The Chaser might seem like a crutch for players, but it's actually terrible in every situation and not worth using, so you're making things harder for yourself! That's pro. You should be writing this tip.Instead of just a menu selection, you even get an overworld. It's just a level select with extra literal steps, but it's appreciated. Helps tie things together, maybe pick up some extra coins.There is a story. The story is "no"."PAID THE PRIIIIIIIICE"- Look, if you think the review is bad, just blame the song. It was the Harvey Weinstein of my dreams.There's a few caveats. The whole "big chunky sprites with big chunky hitboxes" doesn't give you nearly as many ways to play nimbly or stylishly as say, a regular STG, the STG sections themselves are pretty slow and sluggish compared to regular gameplay, and there are just way too many random elements. The spread on the Genie's clutter attack. The platforms in Honey Bee's level. The spawn on the bomb on Hilda Berg. Werner deciding whether or not you're getting parryable objects or just bombs. On half the levels there is at least one major element generated within a random range that means you can get a relatively easy ride to an S Rank or just get clipped.Which is as good as a D rank if you're gunning for the stink.Pro Tip: You don't even get anything for S-Ranking the whole game, not so much as a line of dialogue. If you're gunning for achievements then you can just get the S Rank on King Dice (not very hard, just nail down the dice rolls) and call it a day.That's about all there is to Cuphead. It is a simplistic but responsive, novelty-driven and ultimately fun arcade game. I recommend it to anyone looking for either a quick getaway or someone looking for something to sink their teeth into for a spell to get decent at.
Saibot	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S41B0T/	 Cuphead.. Woow... What a beautiful and Cartoon'ish Journey. As the Game started I instantly fell in love with the artstyle and that beautiful looking cartoon'ish style. When I was a kid I always watched those old disney Cartoons from 1930s and so on and instantly felt a flashback into my Childhood. The warmth... the good old Cartoons with Donald Duck, Goofy and such... It was entertaining and honestly... This Game describes exactly that.It's tough... Really tough... "Dark Souls tough" if you know what I mean, but its worth it. Sometimes you get Damage from something you can't see that fast, because enemys are spawning everywhere.if you're bad at Platformers and Rage really fast, THIS game is nothing for you. But the most important thing is that this game is like the past. You pay for something and get it 100% without Season pass, Story missions behind a paywall or whatever. Good ol' Days.*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*

Soma	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/whitesoma/	Brilliant to look at and listen to, relentless and attention-grabbing in every single aspect of it. Cuphead is a love letter addressed to old school side scroller shooters in the vein of Contra or Metal Slug, which chooses to focus on tough as nails but rarely unfair boss fights instead of cannon fodder enemies. Questionable design choice? Perhaps. Is it still a joy to play regardless of it? Damn straight it is.

clabs bit.ly/gsdiscord	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/claby/	This game obviously has a huge appeal. We all know the style, music, graphics and so on are amazing. However, even though I loved the game at first sight, I didn't buy it. I heard the game was extremely difficult. To put it into perspective, I am trash at these types of games. I was afraid I would get it and then just rage. Anyways, the style got to me and I still bought it. I mean c'mon, it looks awesome!So I played it. And died. And died again. But I kept playing, playing and playing. Sure the game is frustrating to many people, but it just adds to the experience. Furthermore, by restarting the levels over and over gain, you get to appreciate the game even more. Overall, I reccomend this game. Ignore those people who say its too difficult. You don't have to be good to enjoy it! :)

Outsider Sidaroth	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052768877/	I am not really good at this type of game, but this one had the artstyle and music to make me still want to try it, I took much longer than better players to beat the normal game but I eventually did it. It really follows the "tough but fair" aspect that I grew to love when a Boss gave me a hard time or I couldn't get past one of their phases, I would highly recommend grabbing it if you enjoy the lovely Artstyle or catchy OST as the gameplay growns on you and while it punishes you when you make a mistake, it also rewards you with one of the better games this year.I'll be tackling Expert mode eventually and maybe update this review if I ever beat it.
'b	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ready2b/	Cuphead is exceptional. Overall, there is very little to criticize about the game and was simply a pleasure to beat. Mind you, Cuphead is not an easy game and is probably not suited for the casual gamer (even though there is an easy difficulty setting on each level). In addition to a learning curve, Cuphead expects the player to be familiar with 2D platformer/shooters and have decent reaction times. Since 2D platforming is one of my favorite game genres, I had an absolute blast playing Cuphead; especially co-op. For those of you who aren’t new to gaming and are up for a challenge, I cannot recommend Cuphead enough.   Positive:Great example of simple game mechanics with a steep learning curve. Regardless of what others might say, Cuphead is actually very fair. Sure, it might not be easy, but nearly every attack is avoidable if you position yourself and react correctly. I love that you have to understand your strengths and weaknesses and adapt to each situation.The music, especially if you’re a fan of older music, is phenomenal. Not only does it compliment the visual style beautifully, it also amplifies the thrill of fighting each respective boss. The art and animations. OH THE ANIMATIONS. I mean, you can take a quick glimpse at the trailer and feel all the hours that has been put in to making Cuphead look gorgeous. I encourage you to take the time to just sit back and look at the game. Beautiful. My favorite was the facial expressions of the clown boss when he’s riding on a bumper car. Will he charge at me? Won’t he? He’s constantly taunting me with that ridiculous smile, but I love it.My favorite part of Cuphead is the level/boss design. Although the game mechanics are straight forward, every level has a unique theme to it, like a vegetable garden, a pirate ship, or a candy castle. Each level is composed of unique enemies, backgrounds, music, animations, attack patterns, and more. This is great for three reasons: Extremely aesthetically pleasing. It feels like you are bombarded with new high quality visuals and audio every time you enter a level. You are constantly met with new challenges. No boss is like the other. You are expected to die, learn, and adjust to be able to take down any boss. Each boss has several stages/forms. You are expected to adapt and refocus as you whittle down the boss’ HP, which to me is very exciting. It’s like you get several adrenaline shots throughout the boss fight – it’s painfully addictive. All in all, it never feels like you are repeating yourself. Cuphead is extremely refreshing and exciting from beginning to end.Co-op is great, but what is less mentioned is how well balanced co-op actually is. You get to revive each other, but both players’ HP are considered when receiving a stage score - it doesn’t matter if one player plays perfectly, the score will be based on the worst performance. Furthermore, the more often you die, the faster your spirit rises, allowing for a shorter revive window. It’s also very fair that bosses are more difficult and have more HP when you play co-op. The difficulty also seems to readjust when one of the players die. To clarify, if one of the players dies (and cannot be revived), the boss difficulty reverts to what it is for single player (less HP, fewer projectiles). It’s simply brilliant, as it keeps the game challenging but fair. Perhaps I am just imagining things, but if Cuphead was really designed in this way, I must give props to Studio MDHR; they really know how to manage difficulty.  Once unlocked, you have a decent selection of charms, weapons, and supers available. The equips you choose not only require you to change your playstyle, but can make boss fights much easier or much harder. Experimenting with different combinations to see what worked in which situation was quite fun. Very pleased that Cuphead allows key remapping.Neutral:The total game length left me longing for more Cuphead. Don’t get me wrong, completing the game left me with an immense feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment. Furthermore, Cuphead offers, in my opinion, plenty of replay value, whether you want to improve your level scores, play co-op with friends, or simply rechallenge yourself a few months later. However, Cuphead is so great that I simply wished it was longer. Looking forward to a sequel, Studio MDHR!Negative:The only attack that I found somewhat unfair was the Medusa boss petrify gaze. I could not figure out a way to avoid the attack in its entirety, but instead just had to button mash when petrified and hope that nothing hit me. I don’t mind the petrification per se, as it adds an unique element to the boss, I just wish there was a way to avoid the attack - perhaps a perfectly timed perry?Turns out the petrifying gaze is avoidable, oopsie. Conclusion:★★★★✬ ExceptionalThere is no doubt that a lot of love and care was put into the development of Cuphead. In addition to being an instant classic, Cuphead has earned a permanent spot in my video game hall of fame. Well done Studio MDHR.If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my curator page and group. Your time and support is greatly appreciated!

0dds_0f_Even	Recommended	34.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/R4D_DUDE/	Before I start this review I just want to say the overreaction to the comparison to Dark Souls & difficulty towards Cuphead isn't fair at all in my opinion, the best way to describe this game is that it's a 1920-1930s cartoon version of Metal Slug, Contra & Mega Man.The laughs were great though at all the fails this game has delivered from streamers & etc. with no self-awareness for their surroundings at all even if I don't understand how Cuphead can make someone break their keyboard or controller at all (it's really fun to play with a friend & is more of a chill game for me) when the game makes it clear that every death is the player's fault. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cuphead+rage+compilationThe only way I would understand anyone raging at this game is if your playing pacifist on a Run 'N' Gun level or Expert mode.The tutorial debacle was honestly the cringiest thing I ever watched though & for anyone that hasn't seen it prepare to lose some brain cells. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cuphead+tutorial+failNow to start with this review the only con I can give the game is the default keyboard controls (they're really bad) & my personal preferred control scheme for this game if I do play on keyboard is:AWSD - Move CupheadSpace - JumpUp Arrow Key - Fire GunLeft Arrow Key - DashRight Arrow Key - LockDown Arrow Key - EX MoveE - Change WeaponThe game plays well with a controller too so it doesn't matter what you pick.If you delve into Expert mode I would recommend the Spread & Charge gun combination.You might have to change the gun combo up a bit for hard to hit bosses like the Dragon for example which I would recommend the Lobber & Spread but overall I think the Spread & Charge Combo does the job of finishing boss battles as quickly as possible.  For the rest of the review all I can say is that this is the most original game I have ever played.I'm extremely impressed that the 2 brothers that are responsible for every animation in this game used the actual old methods/techniques that Warner Bros, Fleischer Studios, Disney & etc. used to make Cuphead so unique & I would watch a Cuphead cartoon series if it was possible at all. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXpvF9Z2gG8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxJOw5O0h8ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2ORkIrHUbgI don't have any words on how amazing the Jazz (Maybe Blues too) soundtrack for this game is & the behind the scenes for some of the tracks is extremely impressive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxB2K9l6S6Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6h1vM9W2NMNo DLC at all which is how games used to be so A+ for none of that crap in Cuphead & an extremely fair price for 15+ hours of gameplay.2 player local co-op for this game was the most fun I ever had in a long time since I barely play any multiplayer games anymore because in my opinion online multiplayer was a nice thing for a while but then it got boring when game studios got less creative & I wouldn't be shocked if Cuphead does get an online co-op feature in the future.Every boss battle on this game was fun for me to play against (King Dice is my fav boss & the Phantom Express was my least fav on regular mode + I'm still playing through expert mode so I might update this review) & I hope to god the two brothers behind this game don't dumb the game down in anyway because this game to me can motivate anyone to improve their skills in platformers.The story to the game is pretty straightforward about Cuphead & his brother Mugman owing the Devil money at the Casino so I won't talk much about it.Overall if you haven't played this game yet I would strongly just buy it full price because it's one of the few games in my opinion that deserves it & Studio MDHR don't let greedy corporations like Microsoft or EA for example buy you out.P.S. As irrelevant IGN is here's the 2 brothers fighting the bosses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5danTXIPdEY2 vids I found showcasing what old cartoons inspired Cuphead's characters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyj425wVWNshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64vBvmxulEEFor Xbox One owners (Not sure about PC) you can expect a physical copy of Cuphead in the future http://nichegamer.com/2017/10/09/physical-release-planned-cuphead/For something really cool I found a vid of someone playing Cuphead on an old Black & White CRT TV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPcYW9dTAUwEDIT: After doing further research I just noticed that the 2 brothers might be Street Fighter enthusiasts if you compare Ryu & Ken with the frogs + Balrog (Bull), Sagat (Tiger) & Vega (Snake) with the slot machine symbols off the final phase of the Clip Joint Calamity level. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQsHVkXqEvwThe Rat Pack (infamous jazz music group from the 1900s featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin & other famous jazz singers) is a huge influence for the very 1st boss battle in Cuphead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mps2dyypfGwhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Rat+packKing Dice (my fav boss in Cuphead) is heavily inspired by famous Jazz singer Cab Calloway who was featured in Fleischer cartoons like Betty Boop's Snow White for example (the singer for King Dice's theme song has a resemblance to Louis Armstrong) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDATXtewPrgOne of the animators for Cuphead has revealed that the Baroness Von Bon Bon boss was heavily inspired by starlets from the 1900s https://twitter.com/NawrockiTina/status/927190286022971393Archive: https://archive.fo/jqXyAGrim Matchstick's name is a reference to Grim Natwick of Betty Boop fame (responsible for drawing/animating her) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_NatwickThe Game Over Screen for the Cigar's face in the King Dice battle is heavily inspired by Lou Bega https://youtu.be/amfa5lL9duo?t=9m32shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK_LN3XEcnwOne of the Studio MDHR animators explains the creation process of Cala Maria https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmGb-jU3uVQThere's a ton of videogame references in Cuphead but I'm not going to name them all because that would take forever.EDIT 2: After playing for a while on Expert mode my least fav bosses have been Cala Maria, The Devil & Wally Warbles.If you value your sanity I would advise doing both Wally Warble & Cala Maria (both of these bosses are pushovers in regular mode) 1st if you're going for the expert mode achievements because they both have terrible patterns to memorize & most of the time the RNG will screw you over.Sally Stageplay, Captain Brineybeard (I struggled with him on regular mode but I had fun learning his pattern) & King Dice are my fav bosses to go through on Expert mode.EDIT 3: Studio MDHR's future is looking very good & I'm happy that they're going to continue using the old 1920s-1930s animation style in their future games. http://nichegamer.com/2017/11/15/cuphead-developers-are-sticking-with-hand-drawn-2d-animation-for-their-next-game/I don't care for any type of award shows but it's still good to see that the gaming industry still values creativity. https://twitter.com/StudioMDHR/status/931563861861421058https://twitter.com/StudioMDHR/status/931567315526746114https://twitter.com/StudioMDHR/status/931625031028891648EDIT 4: I nominated this game for the “Even Better Than I Expected” Award for Steam's 2017 Autumn sale (probably a bit contradictory since I mentioned in EDIT 3 that I didn't care for award shows at all)

It's also a superhard oldschool megaman/contra thing, so it's controversial like that. Run & gun levels and lots of complex multistaged boss fights with randomized patterns.

ZelosZalis	Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZelosZalis/	Cuphead is a aesthetic platformer that focuses on bosses, while there is a few platforming stages, the bosses are the meat of the game and what people remember from it.The game is visually amazing, the setting and environments all are based on the "golden age of animation" from the 1930s. While nothing is a direct rip off of any existing real character, they are so well done they could totally pass for real characters from that time. It pretty much never leaves this style either, no power or effect used contrasts this style so it flows seamlessly, Its absolutely gorgeous.As far as the controls to the game go it all feels fairly responsive and it all works, you have a decently wide range of shot types and powers so you can go at a boss with a different style if one is not working, and there are multiple charms to make use of that also can completely change how you go at bosses, be it aggressively or defensively. You do need to make use of these styles as well because one style wont work on some bosses at least to the most effective level. Lastly the game uses what it calls a "parry" system, which more accurately is a guard absorb, any shots or attacks that are pink can be parried to destroy the object and gain special meter, learning and mastering this is required in this game.The Game boasts 19 bosses, each with their own styles of attack and themes, all the bosses attacks lend to their designs, some of their specials you see if playing on regular or expert get a little weird (A queen bee turning into a "buzzbomber" GET IT!?) but it still is enjoyable to fight all of it. Some bosses you have to fight in a 2d shooter mode as an airplane which were my least favorite parts of the game simply because there wasn't any variation to how you can configure your character going in, so they are only fought one way. Still I say "least" but they were still enjoyable, just the weakest part of the fun.Cuphead is a game that has a reputation. People compare it to being the "Souls" of platforming. I more compare it to being the "Mirror's Edge" of platforming. The patterns are simplistic enough that anyone can eventually beat the game, but you'll always lament that stupid hit you took. So much like mirrors edge it makes you compelled to have the perfect run with flow unbroken. That might be the biggest secret to the game design, the patterns seem extremely overwhelming at first but then you slowly realize just how simple they are, much like the animation of the time.Overall the game is very fun and I reccommend it, but even when I say the patterns are simplistic there is some skill demand in this game and I don't recommend it if you struggle at platformers on the whole. Overall though you can't really go wrong with this game, its a fun ride and with simplistic mode to learn the patterns and the heart upgrades anyone can at least beat the game.

Zeebrax the Astral Lifejacket	Recommended	26.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072182182/	Never doubt that this is a finely crafted piece of software.  Cuphead and Mugman respond as fluidly to your button taps as the sumptuous rubber hose animation suggests -- and I don't need to tell you that the art and animation are nonpareil, because you can see that with your own eyes.  Paradoxically, while this gorgeous animation, which is fully worthy of the great Fleischer Studios, has universal appeal and makes everybody who sees two seconds of it want to immediately start playing, the game itself is only for a small subset of enthusiasts:  gamers who like incredibly hard, shoot-em-up 2D platformers.  And guess what?  It's even mean to those people!    Being an NES kid with a masochistic streak, I had some fun with the game.  I even grabbed all achievements save one, and I am just about there.  The problem is, half of the time, I wasn't having any fun.  I forced myself to hurriedly uninstall Cuphead after I began losing my sanity to King Dice's expert mode (my will was shakin', my mind was breakin' every time I reached those far-spaced pink cards).  Yes, yes, I know nobody twisted my arm to try to 100-percent the game -- but there's something unwholesome about the way it combines adamantine difficulty with gameplay addictive as heroin to someone of my gaming proclivities.  I say I enjoyed the game some, and I did when all was said and done, but it felt like every time I played it, I compulsively played far past the point of fun because I just couldn't "let the damned game beat me."  The emergency uninstall was a last-ditch attempt to salvage the remainder of my vacation for more enjoyable things.Cuphead is a well-designed game in many ways, but I think it's a little much for anyone, not just casuals.  MDHR Studios are a one-of-a-kind talent; they just need to lighten up next time around.

Chip	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILikeHotShowersAndRamen/	Cuphead, the game you'll manage to both love and hate at the same time.Obviously, this wouldn't be a Cuphead review if I didn't talk about the graphics, and yes, like all the critics say, the artwork and animation truly is phenomenal. The 1930's cartoon style is very unique and makes the game stand out from other indie games. So much love is put into the game, that I even feel it even helps with the difficulty of the game, which I'll touch on later. Each and every boss has a interesting, eye catching design to them, making them even more memorable (if the difficulty didn't already do that for you.). I will admit, the default control scheme is... bad, on both keyboard and controller. Though, I won't say the game is any worse because of it, as you can easily just remap them to your liking. I was able to find my fit pretty quickly. Here are my control recommendations.Controller:Jump: AShoot: RTEx Shoot: BSwitch Weapons: LBLock: RBDash: LTKeyboard:Jump: SpaceShoot: DEx Shoot: ASwitch Weapons: QLock: WDash: Left ShiftAt times, the gameplay can feel a little wonky, notably the parry ability. This isn't always the case though, most of the time the platoforming and gameplay are perfectly fine, but at times it really can feel like the game has cheated you out of a parry or hit.Again, this wouldn't be a Cuphead review if I didn't talk about difficulty. For some people, the difficulty may not suit them,  but I think most of the game lands on the "challenging but not absolutely frustrating" level of difficulty. While there are some parts that truly do feel frustrating, all the hints the bosses give you with their attacks help the player inch closer to beating it, one death at a time. Going back to the artwork of the game, I feel that with all the soul that's put into these bosses, when you put down the controller in anger, you can't help but appreciate how much love is put into them, which can really encourage players who feel like giving up on the game to get back into it.The music is also crafted well, with the 1930's in mind. Hell, I even sometimes find myself waiting for the choir boys to finish singing in the menu before I began playing again. The soundtrack that accompanies you along the journey is filled with smooth jazz, ragtime, and more, which definitely makes the journey all the better.Cuphead is definitely one of the best games I've played in 2017, with it's phenomenal artwork, animation, and bosses that give the player a good challenge throughout.
wow	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/verellic4/	Cuphead is a fantastic game so far. The combat is fun, challenging, and the attention to detail with the art is amazing. I wish more developers would put as much care into their games as the Cuphead devs.

seal	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skiiiiz/	Ok, I'm going to start this off by saying that I have beat Cuphead and I am currently on the way to beating the game with all A's and on expert mode. So I have felt the full grasp of the game, and I would say, enough to write a thorough review.     As most people have learned by now, Cuphead is not a simple game. It takes determination and perseverance to complete each boss and level. I personally love that fact about the game. After beating a boss the player is rewarded with a great feeling of satisfaction and completeness that many games are lacking in this time. Now, I am not stating that you will have all fun with this game, but I am stating that once completing certain levels or the entire game itself, it will feel worth it as you spent that time learning and understanding how the game mechanics work in that specific stage.     I would also like to point out the amazing art style that completely gives the game a touch apart from other games. It doesn't look anywhere close to realistic with the graphics (which many games are attempting to master at the moment). It gives an old-cartoonish style that is pleasant to the eyes, yet not overwhelming when playing the game. The balance between emphasis and beauty is almost perfect in my opinion. Again, at certain times throughout the game, (partially one or two bosses) the art style may seem to get in the way or distract you in some way, but I found this to give a sense of difficulty as you must look beyond the art, to recognize attacks and maneuver in a way to avoid them, while also paying attention to where the character is.     Now, as much as I can go on and on about the game, there are a few flaws in my eyes that came to my attention. These flaws are small, but can sometimes be frustrating to the player. First, parrying. Sometimes when attempting to parry an object for various reasons it seemingly doesn't work, or you parry the object and you still take damage. I found this slightly annoying throughout levels when attempting to get A's on all bosses, because I would have to completely restart when taking damage in some cases. I know this is most likely my fault entirely, but it is one part of the game that brought me a great deal of frustration.     Another problem I encountered, although it was very rare, is that sometimes the bosses would almost "bug out" while fighting them, and they may just sit still until hit enough to advance to the next phase. This "bug" never once took away from my experience in any way, but I thought I might as well include it in this review so you are not thrown off if this may happen to you.     Overall, Cuphead is a well developed and challenging game not suitable for everyone, but while advancing through the game a great deal of satisfaction will fill the player after trying time and time again to complete a stage. Although, like all games, it has its "bugs" they do not take away from the players overall experience of the game.    Cuphead is a great game, and I would give it a rating of 9/10 or even 9.5/10 for the sheer enjoyment I had while playing the game.

Emperor_SimplyMemes	Recommended	52.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SimplyMemes/	What is Cuphead?"Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings." What do you think of it?I am literally in love with this game. The intense levels and boss fights always get my heart racing and my adrenaline going.

Rock1m1	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/	Whatever Cuphead does right or wrong, you cannot deny a major hook of the game comes from the visuals themselves – there is simply nothing like it out there. Cuphead is a part platformer, part staged-based boss fight drenched with the 1920s circa cartoons and music. The setup is that you, cuphead, wants to come out of the deal with the devil and in order to do so; he needs to defeat a ton of denizens across the map to hand over their souls to the devil. There really isn’t much story here, but it really is not trying to tell one either. The game is side-scroller but there are two main kinds of maps: run and gun and boss fights. In Run and Gun you go from end of the map to another with your life intact. In-between there are tons of enemies to kill and platforming to cross.  There are also gold collectibles across these maps which are optional, however you might want to grab them as much as possible as they are currency for the game’s shop.In the shop you buy new powers for your character. They aren’t necessarily upgrades, but they change a facet of your toolkit. Like of them changes your projectile, while the other one changes your dash ability. The second, by far the majority part of the game are the staged boss fights maps. Here you fight against a single boss which goes through multiple transformative stages which changes the attack pattern which in turn forces the player to adapt. They were really well designed and have a strong sense of character in them to be quite unique. I could recognize a lot of the inspirations behind the bosses from the cartoons I used to watch when I was a kid. The game is hard, very, which is by design. The game requires perfect timing and a lot of memorization. You will be dying a lot but every time you learn something which will help you progress further the next time. The game even shows a meter when you die to show you which stage of the boss fight you were in just before you died and how long you needed to stay alive to see it till the end. The game to its credit loads instantly as soon as you click the retry button so you can jump into the action almost right away and keep that momentum going.Visuals are great but the music is also big part of the game. Era appropriate jazz lights up this wonderful world. I absolutely loved their song selection for a couple of bosses which felt making the whole experience feel like a trip to the 1920s.There are some issues I came with the design though. Sometimes the foreground layer of the map tends to overstep into the peripheral vision, causing issues such as hiding cuphead behind the layer. In a game like cuphead where position and precision is the key, it can be infuriating when you die just because you got blinded by the map design. This issue led me to die quite a few times. The second issue has to do with dodging or escaping during certain boss attacks. The game is confined to quadrilateral moments, as in Top, Down, Left & Right. The issue arises when certain attacks need to be avoided by moving somewhere in between those directions, say Bottom-Left. This, again, will leave the player helpless during situations like this if they are not equipped with a certain dodge modifier. Cuphead was perhaps the most famous of the indie games released in 2017 and for a good reason. This game is artistic splendor which can easily grab the attention on an onlooker. The gameplay is where I feel the game disappoints. It uses difficulty as a core mechanic but doesn’t do much or develop into something further as the game goes on. What you played the first 10 minutes remains through for the next couple of hours until you have beaten the game. Still, if you are looking for a visually striking game which can pull quite a few of those nostalgia strings, Cuphead is a game which you simply must play.7/10 – Good! 
Zero the Letter	Recommended	26.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080936900/	Thanks to this game, I now hate:- Frogs- Slime Balls- Run & Gun levels- Zepplins- Clowns- Candy People (?)- Birds- Run & Gun levels- Dragons- Bees- Pirates and Pirate ships- Dice- Nudist devilsThis is a really good game, please play it
Mr.Frost	Recommended	43.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frostlegendz/	Overall this game is truly incredible and deserves all the love it has been getting in my opinion. The art is a blast from the past and Difficult is hard but fair. I would definitely recommend people who usually do not play platformers to give it a good try because it surely is one HELL of a game.

champion joe	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/champion-joe/	Fun, challenging and great soundtrack :)
Snort Cannon	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/	Cuphead is the long anticipated run-and-gun platformer inspired by the classic cartoons of the 1930s.Story:The game follows on the titular character Cuphead and his brother, Mugman. One day they visit Devils casino and are on a winning streak and decide to try their luck against the devil, who offers them all of the money in the casino if they get another winning roll. However,if they lose he gets their souls. The tempting offers works on Cuphead, but he doesn’t get a winning roll and their souls now belong to the devil. He offers them a deal – if Cuphead and Mugman can collect the souls of other debtors, he will give them their souls back and so they set off on an adventure across the Inkwell Isles.The story itself is of course not as important in an action game but it’s a nice addition and it does take a lot of influence from the old cartoons.Graphics:Anyone that has ever heard of Cuphead will know that the art style is nothing we have ever seen before in a video game. It took quite a long time to accomplish and I can safely say that the wait was worth it because everything in this game is hand drawn from the enemies to environments and bosses themselves.Since the game is heavily focused on boss battles, I have to admit that every boss in this game has an incredibly unique look even though they are based off of common things like bees, cats, vegetables and all ofthe other stuff you’ve seen in the old 1930s cartoons.The animation itself is well made and each character expresses a wide range of emotions which is absolutely awesome considering that everything in the game was hand drawn.Audio:The soundtrack to this game is absolutely phenomenal with each level having its own special theme and every track fits the stage perfectly. It’s not hard to play a single stage and tap your foot to the beat of the music, which happened to me quite a few times. Even after I was done with the game I came back and listened to quite a few tunes while doing my daily activities.Gameplay:Cuphead is at heart a Contra-esque platformer. There are run and gun levels in the game but in total there are only 6 of them and they are very short. Most of the game consists of you fighting bosses and there’s a lot of them. Each boss has multiple forms and it boils down to finishing off every form by shooting them enough times.The game also has a feature which allows you to parry enemy attacks to build up your power meter which will let you use an incredibly powerful attack on the bosses and enemies.Sometimes there are different mechanics that are introduced into the fights. For example, their weak points might be hidden and you have to expose it so you can fight the boss. There are also flying levels which feel like a bullet hell shooter.Of course I have to talk a bit about the difficulty of the game. Everyone pretty much knows at this point that Cuphead is a very difficult game and my experience shows it’s not a walk in the park for sure. Each boss will put all your gaming skills to the ultimate test so if you aren’t well versed in run-and-gun platformers or you’re not that great at difficult games, Cuphead will definitely not be an easy time.In general the gameplay is nothing new but what is there is a lot of fun so I don’t mind it that muchVerdict:So does Cuphead live up to the insane hype ? Well I have to absolutely say that it does. The game has a ton of love put into it which translates into an amazing game. So if you’re looking for a game to test your skills that is a ton of fun and looks good, look no further because Cuphead has you covered.Pros: + Absolutely amazing art style+ Challenging+ Great soundtrack+ Fun boss fights with incredible varietyCons:N/AFinal Rating: 9.5/10You can also read this review at http://www.ticgn.com/reviews/review-cuphead-for-pc/ and for more video game and movie news and reviews check out http://www.ticgn.com/

velbaby	Recommended	38.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VELwithmebaby/	This game can be hard, demands patience and skills, but is very rewarding. Beating all of the bosses after a lot of trial and error grants satisfaction, the same one older games have. Gorgeous old-era cartoon artstyle really gives the game spirit among other platformers, and if you put some work it's not that hard as people say. Filters that you get for playing pacifist runs or beating 15 bossess with A's look very good, but the game is not playable because you can't see the parries (bonus attacks that come at you from the bosses look the same as the regular ones, and if you try to parry you take damage). Variety in guns and skills, but what I like is that you can beat all of the bossess with the default weapon which makes it even more awesome to me. Doing an expert run as we speak. Completed the game on expert and it was a frustrating blast, would die again. Absolutely recommend this game.

King Link	Recommended	21.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglink/	Cuphead has had volumes written on it.  It has been lauded as a critical success and a fan favorite to the point that I wonder if I can add anything to the discussion. At the same time, I review the games I play, and I have played Cuphead, so I suppose I ultimately must take a crack at it as those are the rules I have made for myself. To start, I think the most obvious point is the graphics, and while I rarely discuss the graphics of games, between the variable nature of the PC market, and the fact I feel that graphics don’t always add to the enjoyment of a game, Cuphead is just so damn beautiful it’s hard not to mention it.  MKHD took the rotoscoped style of the 1930s and made a game out of it using animation to get the same feel in their game and they just nail it.  Every single scene and every single moment of the game is just absolutely gorgeous and while I won’t usually lavish praise on a game’s graphics, it’s impossible not to notice just how similar it is to old Fleisher and Disney cartoons.  My wife watched me take down a pirate that looks a bit like a human form of Pete from Steamboat Willie and instantly mentioned the classic Mickey cartoon.  It’s just so good looking and the feeling is spot on for every single boss and level. The other piece that immediately comes to mind when thinking of Cuphead and its brilliance is that there are two types of levels, six levels where it’s “run and gun” which is like most classic 2D platformers and the goal is to get to the end of the level, and nineteen boss level where there’s just a boss.  You just fight a really intricate and amazing looking boss, without a full level before it.The lack of level for the boss allows every boss to be amped up to the max.  I believe every stage has a minimum of three “forms” or phases, and each phase is worthy of praise on its own.  The fights change and morph, some of them are major changes, a few are only a difficulty spike.  Every time you hit new phase there’s a new facet of the fight you’ll enjoy tackling.I have to say, I absolutely love this system.  The ability to constantly try the same boss over and over and learn his patterns is simple in this setup but beyond that it allows the bosses to be more interesting and the focus of the game.  There are 19 back to back levels that are just expertly crafted and only a couple that are less than stellar in every way.   Even when I hate a level, like the damnable dragon of the second act, there’s so much quality design that went into his fight that I respect it, even if it is annoying to me.  I hate the final stage of the dragon battle, I hate parts of the second part, but I love fighting it and knowing that I can, and must beat it. The aforementioned pirate had too much health and probably cost me the most time (or perhaps the dragon) and yet I still had a blast fighting it.  In fact, I couldn’t give up, I never felt like I wasn’t good enough for the game, I just felt that I wasn’t good enough yet.  Whereas with games like Hollow Knight, I had the opposite reaction, that there was a barrier to my skill that may never be overcome.   The gameplay of Cuphead is rather simple.  You can move around, shoot (with an auto fire), jump, dash, a special attack, and then do what the game calls a parry.  Now I shouldn’t have to explain any of those parts except the parry.  The parry allows the player to quickly do a mid-air spin that will allow him to “parry” special attacks.  It gives the player a second bounce and absorbs a one out of five total “EX attack” cards.  These cards are usually given over time for damage, but smart players will gain them from parries instead. The parry system is a bit novel but it's easily one of the strongest parts of the game.  I absolutely love the change of action rather than just dodging attacks the entire game.  The game pushes you towards parrying (even grading you on it) and it’ll help you make quick work of enemies.  Not every attack is parryable, but that’s part of the brilliance.  The first boss will be a potato and he’ll spit attacks at you over and over, every third attack in a row will be purple, and only purple attacks are parryable, if you hit those, you’re golden.  The only downside of the system is sometimes “purple” is a little vague.  I keep getting hit by reddish purple attacks, a few attacks are borderline purple, and while the purple objects are extra purple I wish no colors were even close to that range so it’s clear what could be parried. There’s also an airplane mode, that the player will play through for some of the bosses for at least five bosses.  This is handled differently than the normal gameplay of Cuphead as you can move up and down as well as left and right and doesn’t have a jump.  It also turns your dash into changing the plane into a mini plane that’s faster but has worse range on its main attack.  There’s also a bomb instead of just shooting and you still are able to parry. This gives a different style of gameplay and while I like it a lot for most of them, the fact that the plane isn’t customizable, while the attacks of Cuphead are is a real shame.  The plane feels a little less special than the rest of the game.  They aren’t bad or even just “good” as the bosses are some of the most interesting.  It’s just not as well rounded as the rest of the gameThat customization outside of the plane is one of the better features of the game, though it can be overwhelming.  The player is able to choose two attacks, a super attack (A super can be used when all five EX cards are filled up), and a perk to use.  You can buy these with coins found on the run and gun level (the only reason you have to play those levels) or find around the map. These customizations might make some levels easier or harder depending on what you choose but the most important thing is they’ll help you make Cuphead feel like your own experience even though everyone is fighting the same levels and bosses. I absolutely love Cuphead for what it is.  There are a few more minor issues I still have with it. The game allows you to have autofire, but why do I have to hold my shoot button.  Aside from the charged attack weapon, which could have auto charged and just needed to be pressed to shoot, the game should automatically fire weapons if it’s going to allow auto fire. A few bosses feel out of order.  The dragon is on the second island but on par with the third island.  The Rat boss on the third island is probably easy enough to be on the first island. The run and gun levels are not as good as the bosses, and I’m not sure if they were really needed for how good the bosses feel.   Again, not “bad” but the bosses are always top quality, that the run and gun levels are not on the same par. However overall I absolutely love Cuphead, I’d give it a perfect score because it’s just so well done and graphically it’s gorgeous and the gameplay is very rewarding.  There are nitpicks I can have, and I think there are a few more discussions I want to have on the game, but as it is, it’s just an extremely well-made platformer and I’m thrilled to have played it both in single player and co-op. I apologize for the brevity of the review.  There’s far more to discuss and I have more to say, but Steam has limitations on the size of reviews.   If you want to hear more from me, you can show me that by following my curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/.  If I hit 100 followers I’m planning on taking the next step and creating a website so I can have as much space as games warrant.

`  griM | TeamRazer	Recommended	273.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xrekx/	Cuphead is a charming run-and-gun/shoot-'em-up hybrid that channels Konami's iconic Contra series, while also taking heavy inspiration from the rubber hose animation style that was prominent during 1920s- and 1930s-era cartoons. If you're familiar with the Contra series' fast-paced gameplay, then Cuphead should feel right up your alley: the titular protagonist and his brother Mugman must best a wide variety of perilous stages and bosses to complete their quest. Cuphead lacks the expansive level design featured in Contra and other genre classics, but the hardcore action game gives you a beefy list of complex and satisfying boss fights to overcome, a la Treasure's beloved Alien Soldier.

The style of the game just oozes quality, with beautiful hand-drawn animation, catchy music that fits the 1930s era cartoon style the game emulates. The game chooses to run at 60fps, a creative liberty which does make the animation all at once not quite fit the aesthetic but also looks gorgeous with the added frames in motion and greatly helps the fluid gameplay.It's challenging, but fair. The mechanics are completely solid and responsive, as well as the threats are well telegraphed, which helps that you never really feel it's the controls which make you die rather than your ability. The bosses are creative, memorable, and fun (all with multiple stages) and often are somewhat tasks of dealing with multiple threats at once. There's some platforming run-and-gun levels, and it may take some people used to Mario and the like to un-teach themselves to not jump on enemies heads, but those who were fans of Contra, Gunstar Heroes, etc., should immediately feel at home.Seriously, this is a quality video game that perfectly encapsulates the addicting 'one more go' mentality, and the style, charm, solid mechanics, and fairness in the challenge all make it so instead of frustrating it often is addictingly fun. It truly feels like they hit the nail on the head to accomplish everything they wanted to with this title, and I fully recommend it.

bijisebi agaraa modashi	Recommended	31.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/idleguy/	One of the greatest game of all time, best soundtrack, best art, most balanced bosses I've ever experienced, simple but great story, lovely characters, I loved how unique every boss is with it's own skills and design, it's hard to forget any of them, I love every character in this game even though dragon killed me more than 150 times and took at least 5 hours of trying, I love him too.I'm an artist and I know what it is to make the animation with using rotoscope technique, the fact that artists of this game, sketched, inked (they drew everything by hand because they didn't want old cartoon technique to be lost) and colored every frame in this game, astonishes me thousand times more. Soundtrack is masterpiece, literally a masterpiece. I've never seen anything come together so perfectly as this game does. First time you might say that it's just some jazz tracks and every one of them sounds alike but once you play it and fight a boss, you will find youself humming those tracks, as I was first time. Loved the level design, boss fights are fair, I had moments when I said that "even though this time gets unfair sometimes" but then I realised that it was my bad tactics.. I love how every boss is unique as I mentioned before, for example sugarland shimmy, you get 3 random of the 6 variations of enemies, even they are amazing and different from each other and that's one of the things that makes this game so unique.I loved that they didn't make the game online, I think gamers need more games with cooperative modes which is only playable with using 2 controller on same screen. I brought my laptop to my friends house and played with keyboard and controller with him and we didn't stop laughing for hours, we had more fun in entire 3 hours than I've ever had in online games in my entire life. I liked everything in this game, It's art style, soundtracks, level design, skills, how bosses try to kill you, everything compliments each other perfectly. Thank you MDHR for this masterpiece you gave us. ♥ 10/10.

The love/hate realationship I have with you will never top any other game...Cuphead is an absolute masterpeice. No matter where you look in this game, you can't find anything genuinely bad about it! From the art style to the gameplay, everything about Cuphead goes over, above, and beyond our standards for a video game. When I first heard about this game, I was decently surprised. The art was nice and the music was good to. That was before I even GOT the game! After waiting about a month until Christmas, I was finally able to get it. Boy, was my mind absolutley amazed by the amount of dedication, effort, money, and thought put into this game. HUGE respect for Studio MDHR and their almost-decade long commitment to this game! Heck, the directors even sold there houses and quit their jobs to make this happen!In conclusion, I rate Cuphead a 9.1/10. The art, music, gameplay, and reward for beating an "impossible" boss is phenomanal...
Sonjira	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sonjira/	This is a game that gives the player not just an inventive art style and aesthetic rarely seen in games - if even in more mainstream animation - but a complete well-rounded experience where every aspect of its design, from the aforementioned art, to its gameplay, to its difficulty and level design, feed back into a cohesive loop where everything is informed by all that surrounds it.It would be quite simple to stop the buck at the games beautiful, detailed, evocative art style, filled with zest and character and a genuine love and understanding of the classic cartoons that inspired it - adhering to not only their basic design but to the way the original animators own influences and limitations affected the way they crafted their work. Putting forth all this detail, some might have forgiven this game if it had been a simple visual treat at the sacrifice of its gameplay.Yet this game does not do that. It instead imagines, "what if all those crazy, buckwild animators and designers back in the day had also been game designers?", and executes it beautifully. The game implements the slower yet exaggerated movements of its main characters in the form of tight, yet highly responsive controls, challenging you to navigate the difficult-to-predict movements and patterns of insane bosses. At first glance, one might feel the controls to be too "slow" for the fast-twitch platforming the game frequently demands. But it really all comes down to understanding the minute ways your jump-n-shoot abilities function, and being able to execute just so to thread the needle and land a pin-point blow.I could go on, but I must say this game is truly a KNOCK-OUT by almost any metric. It's a loving marriage of both an inspired art direction and well-tuned gameplay that should be cherished for the gem it is.

🤔 Jinn XV	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198338776245/	The best run and gun indie game i have played. The early 90s insipired cartoon animations are amazing with great detail in all level. The music for individual levels is perfect and does not hider you from the gameplay. Unique bosses that have their own challenge factor. Co-op is really fun and engaging. The game is relatively short completed it in 8-9 hours. The hardest challenges come when you finish and try to do runs without getting hit etc. For the price it is definantly worth it. With all the awards it just shows how good this game is.  » Value for money with the content it offers.» No stupid season pass or preorder bonus.» Only a few occasional glitches.» Gameplay is fun and challenging.» Nostalgical atmosphere.10/10 Would cup again.
MattG54321	Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mattg54321/	It's refreshing to see a game oozing with passion and care amidst a sea of cash grabs and shovelware.Highly recommended for those who enjoy the art style and like a challenge.Buy this game if...You enjoy the 1930s cartoon aesthetic. StudioMDHR absolutely nailed it. This game is one of the most beautiful, best sounding, most characteristic games I've ever played. It speaks for itself. Enough said.You like a challenge. A real challenge. This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Luckily, the gameplay is extremely enjoyable, rewarding, and fair, so you'll keep coming back for more.You're willing to spend hours developing strategies and practicing mechanics to beat some of the bosses. Some bosses are significantly harder than others, but make no mistake: the hours of hard work pay off the moment you hear "KNOCKOUT!"You like variety. Every boss feels different from the rest, and the flying levels and "Run 'n' Gun" sections offer a nice change. Please note that the core of the game never changes. You'll always be frantically avoiding things while shooting.Improvements I'd like to see:Mouse support. You can't operate the menus with a cursor, and mouse buttons aren't supported. I was hoping to use WASD for movement and mouse buttons for shooting, but you can't bind mouse buttons.A practice mode. The simple difficulty is a joke. Whole phases and moves of bosses are cut out. If you're stuck on the final phase of a boss, there's no way to isolate that section to practice. You'll have to fight your way to it every time.Some indication that I'm damaging a boss. Excluding phase changes, bosses show no sign of damage besides flashing white when you hit them. When you finally defeat them, it's often abrupt. You can't see how far you made it until the death screen. 
-=Sp33dFr34k=-	Recommended	4.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sp33dfr34k85/	People say this game is hard. It might be for todays standards, we are used to linear and straightforward games now. We have all been spoiled with awesome looking graphics, which in it's turn causes developers to let the focus on the gameplay go. For people who remember gaming in the 8 and 16 bit era, this games difficulty would be average I'd say.The game has beautiful 30's cartoon style graphics , fluent and intuitive gameplay and a very varied arsenal of gameplay, surroundings and enemies.You can run, duck, shoot, parry and dash, pretty much like your usual action platformer Mega Man style. Next to that you can purchase powerups and you have special attacks. It is very intuitive, so you get the hang of the controls rather quickly. You can even play with a buddy using a second controller (too bad it's local play only, but still a cool feature).Like in the old days, there are no checkpoints. So once you're dead, you have to start the level over again. You WILL definitely get to know the real meaning of 'retry' as you will need to use it often. You still keep your progress within the game like in Super Mario World for example. The bossfights are epic, it's all about recognizing patterns and learning to anticipate based on these.TLDR, the gameplay is as smooth as Mega Man, the difficulty is like Contra and the art/sound style of the game is just w-o-w. 10/10!
Segab	Recommended	15.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/segab/	When this was announced I was afraid it would be all style over substance, in other words only look good and be boring, or be hard for the worse reasons. Cuphead turned out to be amazing. It excels in every aspect. It absolutely nails the art style, the music, the sound design, but also the gameplay. The boss designs are really clever, both thematically and in their attack patterns. Boss battles are really hard, but so well designed that there's always a way to beat them without ever taking a hit if you equip the right weapons and dodge properly. RNG is never a problem because there's always a tell before it happens, you just need to be quick to react. All bosses feel unique, and learning the patterns and adapting is half the fun. Even the airship levels are unique and great. I beat the game on Normal difficulty in co-op then came back and beat it again alone on Normal and Expert difficulty. It was a blast every time. I recommend changing the default key bindings though!I can't wait for Studio MDHR's next game!
JACK	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963708554/	This game is fair but extremely hard. I don't recommend it for the impatient person or someone who wants a casual experience. This is also not the king of game you can beat in one sitting. For me it took about three weeks (totally 16 hours) of on and off gaming because it took that much time to beat each individual boss. Technically you could beat this game in an hour but the difficulty of the bosses prevent that. I often found myself stuck at a wall because I couldn't figure out how to beat a boss. My strategy was to sleep on it and come back to it another day. And usually if I managed to beat a boss I'd call it a day because it had taken so much time and energy to achieve it. The secret to winning Cuphead is to learn all of the bosses "tells." Once you learn the tells you can anticipate their next move. The next secret is to use the appropriate power combination to give you just a good enough edge to beat it.
TheBigNoon	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070700359/	If you enjoy games like mega man/contra and a 1930s cartoon art style this game is for you!
EpicMic	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/epicmic/	Best cup game I have ever played10/10
Madly	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198240583882/	It's not Dark Souls or Bloodborne. It's its own thing, and that's a good thing.
NeoRizer	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/	Cuphead is a side scrolling action platforming shoot 'em up game. It utilizes early Disney esque art styles for it's visuals with complementary Big Band Jazz (Swing) and Barbershop back ground music to really emphazise the 1930's theme it's presenting. You bet the Devil on a game of dice, now it's time to pay the price.Cuphead and Mugman are the main protagonists of our tale of side scrolling local co-op only action (just thought I'd get that out of the way). They made a deal with the Devil on a game of craps, thinking they couldn't possibly lose, they were wrong. The plot sets the mood from the very beginning, a game with an innocent cartoonish look and innocent looking characters but underlying adult themes are afoot... moral of the story? Don't gamble with your life.GameplayCuphead plays very much like the original Contra games, except the colors are reversed this go around. P1 (Cuphead) is red and P2 (Mugman) is blue. You walk around an overworld map choosing destinations to venture in to. Some are bosses, some are side scrolling levels. There's always more than a single option available to you but in the end you have to complete every stage to progress the main story. There are side quests to embark on by talking to overworld NPC's and hidden coins to collect. There's a shop to buy different styles of shots and charms to help balance out your weaknesses as a player.Once an area is selected you then choose your difficulty. At first only Simple (Easy) and Regular (Normal) modes are unlocked. Once you finish the game, Expert (Hard) mode becomes available. Disclaimer: The final two boss fights in the game can only be played on Regular (Normal) and Expert (Hard) modes.The differences between modes are as follows:Simple (Easy): Enemies have slower attack patterns, their attack cycle pool is a bit more shallow, meaning they won't use all of their available attacks and some phases of a boss fight will be removed entirely.Regular (Normal): A normal level of play for above average gamers. Most boss phases are available, and most attack cycles are available, enemies attack at an increased speed over Simple (Easy) mode. Highest rank you can earn is an A+.Expert (Hard): For true masochists. All the stuff from Regular (Normal) mode is here, except now all boss attack speeds are increased by about 1.5. Some bosses also have an extra phase added in and some even combine attacks together. It's like playing the game on turbo mode but you can now earn the coveted S Rank if you perfect the stage. Good Luck!Once you've made your choice in difficulty you proceed to shoot, jump, parry and dash your way through some side scrolling areas (6 in total to be exact) but the meat of the game is just an all out boss brawl. There's over 20 bosses to fight all with unique patterns and looks, no two bosses are alike so you're going to have your work cut out for you.At the end of each stage you're graded on your performance based on certain criteria: How long did it take you to finish the fight / stage?How many hits did you take? How many parry attacks did you perform?How many super attacks did you land?Trying to get A+ (on Regular mode) or S ranks (on Expert mode) seems to be the meat of the game and where most of your time is going to be spent. You could always just breeze through stages never thinking twice about how well you did but if you want to be a Cuphead master, you'll have to practice. Rank in no way hinders you from completing the game, the ranks are inconsequential to your progression of the story. Once you finish a level or beat a boss, more of the map will open up to you and you can venture onward.Final ThoughtsIt's a fantastic game. As someone who grew up with Contra, it's a love letter to that game series as well as fans of a lost age of art and music. It's actually one of the only high quality side scrolling shoot 'em up games on Steam of it's kind that stays true to form. Simple yet incredibly challenging.I would recommend the purchase if you're interested in something different for a change. Put down the mouse and keyboard and pick up ye olde game controller and go to town. I played this game for 8 hours straight and finished it in a single sitting. It took a lot of patience and concentration but it's completely do-able on Regular mode... Simple should be a breeze for the casuals. It helps to have grown up in a generation where this genre was a household name and not so niche as they've become today... If you're an old boy like me, this game should be an adequate challenge but not impossible by any stretch of the imagination.There's a lot of stigma going on with this game right now and some gamers are saying the difficulty curve is causing them to think twice about purchasing. Rest assured there's a difficulty selection built in to the game before you access each level so there's really no excuse to be afraid... if you can't handle it, play on Simple mode. Remember you have 2 hours to refund.The difficulty spikes fairly quickly so you know, just don't be a Dean Takahasi and take 10 minutes to beat the tutorial and you'll be able to see if the game's challenge is truly for you. Although if it does take you more than an hour to beat the first stage even, I would suggest refunding it... you're not going to make it.Even though ratings are highly subjective and don't really mean anything, it's like an 8 / 10. An above average game and will end up being a cult classic.Gripes 'O MineIt's a great game but it's not a perfect game by any means, it can be insanely unfair and frustrating at times, especially if you're going for A+ or S Ranks... this is where the game shows it's true imbalance.The dev's could have did more with the equipment system as it seemed kind of basic. Aside from the peashooter, spread shot and chaser (homing) weapons, the extra weapons and charms we never saw in promotional videos were all lackluster and really gimmicky... I tried them all once and switched back to the basic stuff. The variety of weapons just could have been a bit better. There's also no way to upgrade your weapons either, weapons are always at the same strength level, you'll never feel over powered in this game ever.Some bosses are a bit ridiculous in length. Some bosses can take upwards of 10 minutes to complete which is a bit crazy and defeating at times. It actually makes the first phases of the boss fights tedious, unfun and annoying to have to endure if you're only having trouble on the final phase.I'm also not impressed you can't choose to play as Mugman in single player. You're basically forced to play as Cuphead in single player mode... not that it matters, it's just an asethetic thing but I personally perferred Mugman's design over Cuphead... options are always nice and it wouldn't have taken them much effort to throw in a character select screen before you start playing.It only has local co-op which is also another cop-out from the developers. I mean I get it, it's supposed to be retro but please, we're living in 2017, there's no excuse for not programming some netcode in this thing just for convenience sake. The developers claimed if the game sells well they may include online co-op.  I'm not going to hold my breath on that one. If we ever do get it, this game will be long forgotten by that point.

I found it hard to shake off the big silly grin the whole time. Originally, I thought there was a level before every boss fight but apparently there are more boss fights than the progressive levels, so there is that.I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone.And I don't think I need to talk about the art style now, do I?
Lazarus	Recommended	30.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/therealorpheus/	An indie game that is arguably better than a majority of AAA releases today.It takes a lot of time and passion to produce a game such as Cuphead, and it really paid off. Frame by frame, each of the characters (even the throwaway enemies) are animated in such a professional way, it's really a beauty to look at and just admire the love the creators had for this game. This is just one of many things that make Cuphead so worthwhile, as looks aren't everything. The gameplay is difficult, but in a fair and enjoyable way (to those who enjoy not being handed an easy victory, anyways), giving us an experience that is waning out of the realm of video games due to an increase of a more casual market that aims to adhere to the most people possible. Cuphead goes against this grain and gives us real pleasure when we overcome the obstacles put in front of us, we FEEL that we did it with our own skill and dedication, not like it was handed to us by the game developers or that just anybody could do the same. It was so enjoyable that I went back and replayed the game on its Expert mode and it retains that quality the second time through and fails to lose your interest in the slightest.If you want a true and fair challenge to overcome with stylistic, beautiful visuals to accompany it, then Cuphead is definitely a game you must experience.

Gameazoid	Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gameazoid/	SO, want a game that will make you want to throw your controller thousands of times after getting your balls rocked, only to soon succeed after the 1,367th time where you couldn't in Dark Souls? Well this game is up your alley.Cuphead is a fascinating, unique, colorful style game made completely of hand made animations in a 1930's style cartoon like that of the old Walt Disney cartoons, and Merry Melodies (Looney Toons for the newer generation) cartoons. This Run and Gun game is insane in the membrain, as many enemies come at you non-stop, trying to make sure you have the reflexes of a Cheetah mixed with cocane in your blood. If you think there's an Easy Mode? Try Hard and Harder Mode, as the normal difficulty is hard but with the other one, this one will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off till you decide to take your computer and check it out a window, only to grab it, dust it off and hope it still works so you can prove to your Bloodborne friend you can beat a game that's hard as ♥♥♥♥.The soundtrack is magnificent and captures that nostalgic 1930's vibe of the old cartoons back in those days, as the high pumping acoustics get you going and ready for whatever is about to fly from the side of your screen to dog pile you in cowpies.I have yet to beat this game but from playing close to half of the game it's a pain but when you get a boss that's been kicking your balls over and over again, only to soon kick THEIR balls, then it leaves you feeling ready for more... Only to soon get shot in the balls by something even more harder.I know people are sick of the Dark Souls comparisons but when a game is this bloody hard and so damn crazy, it can't be helped. Great game, highly recommended.

SuperHeroes201	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperHeroes201/	This is (so far) my FAVORITE Steam experience! This game is filled with charm and a spicy diffuculty level that will give you a tough time going through even the easiest of bosses. I'll give my thoughts on each type of stage and other things.Bosses- This game's core element is boss fights. I love these fights. The challenge progression is not too easy, not too hard. (although Dr.Kahl's Robot can simply burn even though im Still on world 1 i used the debug menu to fight him and I see why he's so hated.) Anyway, as you may have just read, some bosses are a bit luck based ("cough cough dr kahl cough cough") Others are so enjoyable.Run and Gun- So this is like a Super Mario level except with a cup in 1930's cartoon graphics that uses his hand as a gun. you are pretty well tested on your platforming skills with enemies in your way. Usaully, these levels have a miniboss (they all do although some have more than 1) These could kind of be used as practice for bosses where theres platforming and minions like Rumor Honeybottoms or Grim Matchstick maybe.  an enjoyable exoerience at the most. Mausoleum- this crazy word that took me 5 tries to spell right is one of the easiest modes with op superpowers given upon completion. if you parry on pink objects (parrying is when you press jump in midair to send a hand out of cuphead or mugman's straw to slap a pink object to make it disapper) you have to parry pink ghosts who are trying to reach a vase in the middle of the screen. Do this for long enough and you save the chalice who gives you superpowers to absouletly destroy bosses or make you untouchable for some time. These powers can only be used once you have 5 super cards.I like these Plane Boss Fights- My least favorite part of Cuphead are the boss fights you fight in a plane. these are boss fights but dashing shrinks you and you shoot small bullets, its just not fun.Music- I love this spundtrack, my favorite song is the King Dice theme which can be heard when you enter a dice house.Story- Warning: HUGE SPOILERS YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! It's good. Not the best i've seen, not the worst either. so basically 2 cups named Cuphead and Mugman took a stroll in the forest and got lost, ending up convenently at the ONE PLACE they aren't supposed to go. The Devil's Casino, owned by Satan himself. Instead of running incase of any possible danger, they just walk right on in because game logic. They go undeafted and then lose to Satan Devilson ( i'm assuming thats his last name, jk i just made that up) Who then wants their souls, after begging for mercy, Satan spares them but makes them collect soul contracts given by  killing  knockingout the debtors.

The_Nidhogg	Recommended	33.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_nidhogg/	Absolutely worth $20. This game is old school challenge. The aesthetic design is one of a kind. The game plays like Megaman or Contra. It is not an easy game. Playing on regular difficutly, I died 125 times before making it out of the first area. Can't recommend this enough. This game is phenomenal. This would have been a classic title if it had released on SNES 25 years ago.
falheym	Recommended	3.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198380702110/	This brings back memories in around 90's when I used to play 2D platform games on Nintendo that requires spontaneous reaction to evade, jump to survive as we only have not so many lifes unlike today's games. The soundtracks  remind me of classic cartoon from the 30's, 40's or even 60's. Despite its difficulty, I enjoy most of the game mostly due to the amazing tunes. Highly recommended.

Temko	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Temko/	I dont have a lot of words, mostly because every step of the way they've been replaced by a combined usage of "WoW" and "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK".Its a bos rush title with a phenomenal art style, pacing and grasp of challenge and reward in gameplay. If you read nothing else, read this: Get this title. This is gaming as art... that also kicks your♥♥♥♥♥ Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5N3WiaNs_wText:The visuals should need no introduction, reminiscent of old Disney cartoons the animation and style as well as overall feel of the entire game fits to a T. This very much extends to the sound design that works along side the visuals to create the perfect mix. If there was one negative I can add about the visuals, its the response you get when hitting an enemy that isn't as clear as i feel it should be on occasion.On to the bosses themselves, they are excellent and near damn perfect from start to finish - each boss is designed in a unique way and each fight is rewarding as you learn mechanics and boss movements. The game is hard but its never unfair - so learning the bosses is a massive joy as you see yourself getting closer to that victory screen with each try.Lastly... this game was very much designed for controllers in mind and it shows. Playing on a keyboard is less precise or enjoyable, and the default keybindings are pretty much the worst I've seen this year. They are thankfully full rebindable, so that's not a massive roadblock.Its really... really good. Go play it. If you enjoy the review - do follow my curator feed!. Or check out the various other reviews on  YouTube.

Dravvad	Recommended	16.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/	Nominated for the "Even Better Than I Expected" AwardWhen I first saw Cuphead a few years ago, I think I was drawn in by what many other people were drawn in by: the art style, including the visuals and the audio. The drawings of the game seemed like something very unique in video games, especially with the amount of work that was clearly required to create it. And some early trailers had some funny music going along, which made me really interested in how this game would turn out.I was trying to keep watch on the game for a long while, but was very on-the-fence about it. In the best scenario, I was hoping for the game to simply be fun and for the art to not be the only successful point. As it turns out, the release of Cuphead drastically exceeded that "best scenario" for me.The art in the game was well done down to the little tiny pieces. The music and sound effects all form an interesting perspective that fits with the visual style. The gameplay itself goes along with the cartoons and creates an intense, yet extremely fun, game. And that further recalls video games from just a couple of decades ago, with modern games usually being in a very different basket of experience.Everything coalesces together almost perfectly for me, conquering any worries I had about this game over the years during its production.Literally the biggest complaint against the game from the majority of players is that "It's too hard." Yet there is a large amount of people who have completed the game, and the overall reviews are surely up, up, and away into the positives for Cuphead.While the game is indeed far from easy, and might get you frustrated, I think part of the experience is simply to not let your emotions overwhelm you. This applies to many video games and heck, many day-to-day experiences in life as a whole. The more angry and annoyed you get by the game, it's very likely you will do worse in completing the levels, and it compounds more anger into a vicious cycle.If you take a step back and observe the levels and bosses, making notice of the patterns they use, you can definitely make your way through the game. If you are having an obscene amount of trouble with a certain boss, I would even say to take it one step at a time: focus on one particular attack and learn how to dodge it. Then move onto the next. Then eventually, you need to step up and move a little faster to get past multiple in a row. It is all really building a memory and learning how to tackle a "puzzle" in a way.Cuphead is one of my favorite games of 2017 by far. Such a great experience.
Luihutin	Recommended	16.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966134367/	Reports of this game's difficulty are highly exaggerated. On the regular difficulty, at least. The expert difficulty is where the reported hard parts are, and the game's very enjoyable as is, thanks in no small part to the gorgeous animation and sound design.Cuphead's controls are responsive and the enemies' hitboxes are extremely forgiving. The only reason you wouldn't like this is if you hate Contra or Metal Slug, and those people don't exist. They're a myth.Get it. Now. Don't wait for a sale, just GET IT.

Franz	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Farixy_/	It was ages since I played a game where if I took as much as one hit at the start of a battle I would restart the entire thing because I know how badly it's gonna end, and that's just one of the many reasons why I love Cuphead.The main attraction of Cuphead is of course it's beyond amazing artstyle and animations. MDHR really pulled off some of the most impressive designs I've ever seen in a game.The difficulty, the artstyle, the music, the animations, everything is just wonderful and definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had in years, perhaps even ever.I couldn't recommend this game enough, MDHR has really outdone themselves!
Ren Locke	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/renelcrdxiv/	Extremly difficult and the game is nothing but boss battles but each one is unique and some are fun to fight and some are frustrating to fight against too.

Ferengi	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ferengi4/	An amazing adventure with breath taking art and music that will really show that the video game industry can still make amazing games without ruining them with AAA garbage and lootboxes
Imperfection	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/imperfection9/	I think cuphead is great.  It's challenging but you can definitely get better at it. I have found myself ridiculously close to beating a boss and after all the fails its just so rewarding to win. All it takes to win in cup head is patience and remembering bosses patterns.  Try not to make too many mistakes early in a boss fight so you can save health for later surprises (cuz there is a lot of them) I have a lot of fun streaming this game for friends to watch me suffer and also like to watch their stream for the same reason. I also love the old school cartoon design and all that. Great game overall,  I hate it sometimes when I'm losing but I love it again when I'm winning.  I recommend highly
billbotics	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/billbotics/	There is a reason this game is so popular. It is damn near perfect.Pros:The Aesthetic. This alone is worth the $20. The amount of care that went into creating the sprites, backgrounds, animations, sound effects, and music is worth your money. These developers deserve more, quite frankly. If you see this on sale and you still don't have it, you should actually *wait* until it's full price before picking it up. It's that good.Perfect difficulty. Although this may be a point of contention for some, I believe difficulty vs. reward in this game is perfect. There's a simple mode that allows less experienced players have a shot at seeing most of the content. The regular difficulty is not that difficult. I'm pretty experienced at platformers, but I'm not that good. The game only took me roughly 7 hours to beat on regular on a blind playthrough. Compare that to a game like say "I wanna be the guy" and you'll find the difficulty and amount of time spent very reasonable.Variety. 20+ bosses, each with multiple phases and every single phase is unique. Not to mention multiple weapons, super powers and charms that allow you to brew your own flavor of Cuphead.Unique. I've never played an officially released game like this. I attempted to play "I Wanna Be The Guy" and failed miserably, but that game was never officially released. As far as I know, this is first of this type of game to be officially released. I could be and probably am wrong. But this was a wholly new and unique experience for me, and likely to many others who might pick this up. (Please tell me of other games if I am wrong, because I would love to play them!)Cons:Repetitive. This will flat out turn some people off. You will die many, many times in this game. You will hear the same music, play through the same boss phase, and hear the same sound effects a plethora of times consecutively. This can irritate a casual gamer, but in my opinion, that is where the aesthetic really helps. It's hard to stay mad at Woody Woodpecker stuck in a birdhouse.Casually Difficult. While there is a simple mode in this game, it will still be too much for some casual gamers. If they are not able to beat the first 3 or so levels, that's all they will see. This is true of most games, however. It just may be too difficult for your average casual gamer that may be interested in this art style/aesthetic. If you believe you are one of these people, it may be better to just watch someone play the game. It pains me to say that, but 20 bucks is 20 bucks.Somewhat short. This is a very small gripe, because it feels like there is so much content in this game. The playtime of 7 hours to casually beat the game on regular seemed a bit on the short end to me. Now, I plan on getting all of the achievements and even trying my hand at a speedrun, but for a first time playthrough, it left me wanting. This may have also been enhanced by, again, how truly unique and breathtaking the aesthetic is.I had to write a review for this game, because it's not often that a game comes along and wows you the way that this game did for me. 10/10 - An instant classic. 
Princess Luigi	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mista117/	Even in all three darksouls I never had to restart bosses as much as this game... currently going through for a second beating on expert! Hope they make a sequel it's a nice change of pace in gaming.

The Game Eater	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_game_eater/	When Cuphead was originally shown at E3 I was blown away by its presentation. However, leading up to the release, I was concerned the game wouldn't live up to the expectations, either due to length or mediocre gameplay. I can now say with certainty and incredible joy that Cuphead not only delivers on what it sets out to accomplish, but also manages to place itself among the best games of the year and perhaps of all time. The charming, cartoon story of Cuphead fits well and delivers the motivation you need. However, it's the art style where this game really shines. Cuphead's 30's cartoon style is pulled off flawlessly. The animation is as smooth as butter, the personality expressed in the enemies is phenomenal, and the color palette is perfect. This game blows every other release out of the water this year graphically, thanks to a gorgeous visual style that manages to perfectly replicate its inspiration and produce a timeless look. If there is but one complaint I could note, it's that I wish for slightly more visual feed back when shooting enemies. There is barely any and since there is no health meter the only way to know is by watching the phase change and looking at how far you made it when you die. Cuphead not only succeeds graphically, it's also a musical tour de force. It boasts a stellar jazz-filled soundtrack that is catchy, fitting, and not at all grating which is impressive when you have to retry about 20 to 40 times per level. The sound effects are also snappy and satisfying, however, Cuphead's weapons could use a bit more punch to their sounds. They sound a little too weak.As for gameplay, Cuphead somehow is basically perfect. Every level is methodically plotted out with clear visual cues for obstacles and traps and a good pacing to levels. I could go on for a long time about how each boss fight is brilliant but needless to say, they're all unique, fun, challenging, just long enough, and built with a perfect flow for retrying after dying. The weapons and charms are hit and miss. Some are fantastic and really helpful, some are basically useless. Most have at least one situation where they're beneficial but some like the lobber and whetstone are really not that good. All in all though, the gameplay is 10 cuts above the usual serving from indie and AAA devs. Finally, the brutal difficulty allows this game to take up around 12 or 13 hours which means it's not that short despite the levels not taking very long in one go.Aside from a few little flaws I notice, this game is fantastic. One of the best indie games I've seen and one of the best games I've ever played. A meticulous passion project that proves the industry has been aching for something fresh. The price is fine in my eyes for the amount and quality of content you get. These devs gambled with their lives to make sure Cuphead succeeded and I highly recommend you buy this game to show you appreciate their effort and talent. I look forward to whatever Studio MDHR decides to tackle next because they have some serious skill in terms of artwork and game design.

Diocletian2	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Diocletian2/	Good game with a great soundtrack, low skill level required (since most of your progression is tied to getting lucky in an attack run to defeat a boss, or getting unlucky and being killed by an attack pattern that's non-repeating).99% of your deaths will be to random game elements (ie patterns that you'll see for the first time or that don't frequently repeat, or occlusion in the foreground of the environment blocking or obscuring your vision) and pattern recognition is really secondary as a game element.It's a meme to compare this to Dark Souls - but it's nothing like DS in terms of difficulty or learning attack patterns to defeat bosses. It's a fun game, but c'mon, it's nowhere near the level of Dark Souls in terms of gameplay, difficulty or skill required.With the foregoing in mind, fun game, and the music is fantastic. Priced just right for the content you get - but where is the online co-op?

Brandon	Recommended	11.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chrosyx/	When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our

With_Teeth26	Recommended	43.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999209563/	First of all, I would like to say that I suck at Cuphead, and after 8 hours I've only completed world 1 and one boss in world 2. Probably would have taken me longer to get this far if I didn't play through most of world one in co-op. secondly, I'll say that I think everyone should play this game. The visuals/animations speak for themselves, and when combined with the glorious jazzy soundtrack, make for such an energetic and catchy presentation that you won't mind dying over and over to the same boss. If you are like me and suck at these types of games (I wasn't able to finish Ori and the Blind Forest), success will require playing through each boss/level for 30 mins - an hour (or longer!) while you memorize the patterns of each stage and try and get your fingers to cooperate. Sound tedious? Its actually not, as many bosses contain randomized elements that take a while to see all of/figure out, and I found the process of slowly figuring out and getting further into a level satisfying, and victory when it finally comes is elating.

HaydenC	Recommended	28.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/memememememmemeeememiegnijaeg/	I honestly have nothing bad to say about this game.The bosses are literally perfect by design, and the levels are amazing.Cuphead is a ton of fun, even if you're dying hundreds of times to those stupid projectiles you see out of the corner of your eye. The music is literally perfect, and so is the art. Speaking of the art, it's f*cking amazing. Some of the best artwork I've ever seen for a video game, and I've been playing games my whole life.When this was announced, I thought it would be one of those pretentious indie games at an incredibly high price point. However, Cuphead is humble, and it respects you. It's only 20 dollars too, and that's a steal. Honestly, I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth. Had the game only been the length of the first world, I would have been satisfied. But nope, it keeps going, and it kept making me happier and happier.It's not about the money or length, though, because Cuphead is art, plain and simple.Get this game, PLEASE. The developers sold everything and gave up a lot to make this game happen. In doing that, they made one of the best 2D games I've ever played.

Diocletian2	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Diocletian2/	Good game with a great soundtrack, low skill level required (since most of your progression is tied to getting lucky in an attack run to defeat a boss, or getting unlucky and being killed by an attack pattern that's non-repeating).99% of your deaths will be to random game elements (ie patterns that you'll see for the first time or that don't frequently repeat, or occlusion in the foreground of the environment blocking or obscuring your vision) and pattern recognition is really secondary as a game element.It's a meme to compare this to Dark Souls - but it's nothing like DS in terms of difficulty or learning attack patterns to defeat bosses. It's a fun game, but c'mon, it's nowhere near the level of Dark Souls in terms of gameplay, difficulty or skill required.With the foregoing in mind, fun game, and the music is fantastic. Priced just right for the content you get - but where is the online co-op?

The Game Eater	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_game_eater/	When Cuphead was originally shown at E3 I was blown away by its presentation. However, leading up to the release, I was concerned the game wouldn't live up to the expectations, either due to length or mediocre gameplay. I can now say with certainty and incredible joy that Cuphead not only delivers on what it sets out to accomplish, but also manages to place itself among the best games of the year and perhaps of all time. The charming, cartoon story of Cuphead fits well and delivers the motivation you need. However, it's the art style where this game really shines. Cuphead's 30's cartoon style is pulled off flawlessly. The animation is as smooth as butter, the personality expressed in the enemies is phenomenal, and the color palette is perfect. This game blows every other release out of the water this year graphically, thanks to a gorgeous visual style that manages to perfectly replicate its inspiration and produce a timeless look. If there is but one complaint I could note, it's that I wish for slightly more visual feed back when shooting enemies. There is barely any and since there is no health meter the only way to know is by watching the phase change and looking at how far you made it when you die. Cuphead not only succeeds graphically, it's also a musical tour de force. It boasts a stellar jazz-filled soundtrack that is catchy, fitting, and not at all grating which is impressive when you have to retry about 20 to 40 times per level. The sound effects are also snappy and satisfying, however, Cuphead's weapons could use a bit more punch to their sounds. They sound a little too weak.As for gameplay, Cuphead somehow is basically perfect. Every level is methodically plotted out with clear visual cues for obstacles and traps and a good pacing to levels. I could go on for a long time about how each boss fight is brilliant but needless to say, they're all unique, fun, challenging, just long enough, and built with a perfect flow for retrying after dying. The weapons and charms are hit and miss. Some are fantastic and really helpful, some are basically useless. Most have at least one situation where they're beneficial but some like the lobber and whetstone are really not that good. All in all though, the gameplay is 10 cuts above the usual serving from indie and AAA devs. Finally, the brutal difficulty allows this game to take up around 12 or 13 hours which means it's not that short despite the levels not taking very long in one go.Aside from a few little flaws I notice, this game is fantastic. One of the best indie games I've seen and one of the best games I've ever played. A meticulous passion project that proves the industry has been aching for something fresh. The price is fine in my eyes for the amount and quality of content you get. These devs gambled with their lives to make sure Cuphead succeeded and I highly recommend you buy this game to show you appreciate their effort and talent. I look forward to whatever Studio MDHR decides to tackle next because they have some serious skill in terms of artwork and game design.

Xemi	Recommended	23.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hirago/	Cuphead set out to be a tribute to the 1930s cartoons and it succeeds. The game itself, even when leaving the gameplay out of the equation, is a work of art. The seemless, smooth animations, paired with the art-style and authentic music create an atmosphere worth experiencing. Oh, and it's a tough game.The basic premise is simple: You lost a bet against the Devil, and now you must collect the contracts of his other ''debtors'', in order to save your own... Cup. This basically means you are mostly walking around the map, engaging bosses in fun, interactive, hectic and very diverse battles. Not all bosses are of the same quality, but on the whole you're in for plenty of memorable fights, each with its own distinct character. In between the game offers some traditional Run 'n Gun levels, which are challenging and fun in their own right. There's a shop where you can buy upgrades, which are just diverse enough to give you some sense of tactical decisions as far as what weaponry you take with you for a particular boss. You are, for the most part, left at the mercy of your own skills, however. The art-style lends itself for a rather over-the-top-style and it fits this game like a glove. There is always something going on in this vivid game.In the end most of the game boils down to a bunch of trial and error session, where you learn patterns and tells to get further and further in order to defeat every boss and clear every level. The high production value and diversity of bosses/levels keep it fresh, however. And there's a co-op mode, so you can laugh at each other's pathetic skills.So should you get this game? I'd say yes, definitely. However, to help you decide, here are the pros and cons.Pros:+ Amazing art style and animations+ Amazing soundtrack+ Gameplay is smooth. Use a controller though!+ Variety in bosses and stages+ Co-op mode is great.+ Modes to unlock, grades to earn. There's plenty to keep the perfectionist busy.+ Winning is very satisfyingCons:- Some bosses can get a bit too hectic, resulting in some luck involvement. Not all boses are of the same quality, mechanic-wise (visually they're all stunning).Mixed:+- The difficulty can be off-putting if you are not into bullet-hell and punishing gameplay, which means you may not get to see all of the designs the creators put so much effort into. If you like a challenge, however, this is your kind of game.+- Not the longest game you'll ever play, especially if you don't have much trouble with the difficulty.+- Co-op is local, so you'll need someone to physically be present to play.Convinced? Get it. There is no game quite like it.A brawl is certainly brewing! You're up!
Fusapple	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fusapple/	Linux/wine user here ,i confirm that the games works perfectly on staging 2.18 versioni don't know how to describe Cuphead but i would say that it's the result of the formula : bullet hell + platformers it is challenging and has a nice soundtrack and some beautiful aesthetics resembling the old cartoon graphics , not forgetting it's simple good story .the versatility of the bosses and the difficulty of the game makes this latter less boring to the player.but the price is kinda high for a game that offers you arround 15 hours gameplay assuming you're heading for a 100% ( 30 hours if you're a journalist , maybe  more ? )10/10 is what this one will get from me!
ispaure	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ispaure/	I usually will hate games that are "difficult" for the following reasons: bad responsiveness, bad controls, goal that feels completely out of reach, game punishes too much. A few hours into Cuphead, I already love the game. It is difficult but not frustrating. Every single time I died so far it was entirely my fault. When you die, you start the level again. You don't lose your abilities, you're not pushed backwards a half hour back. Cuphead is ultimately fair and this is why I enjoy it.The visuals are so unique and make it stand out. They got the old animation style perfectly and the chromatic abberation/film noise/blurriness are all nice touches.The game feels really polished. I have to get back to it now, but can already say I recommend this game.
UkuleleNinja	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/UkuleleNinja/	First Level, Died 16 times.I'm questioning my life choices.Good game.
Inflamed pancreas	Recommended	70.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198190360394/	Cuphead is an amazing game, and i'd highly recommend it. Starting with the visuals, they are amazing. The game tries to use the style of cartoons from the 1930s and it fulfills this by having all the graphics be hand drawn before being put in game and it real shows. Next, the boss fight are (for the most part) really challenging and fun to fight. Each boss has multiple forms which all have their own attacks and mechanics. These diffrent forms prevent the boss from becoming boring and repetitive. And the sound track is fantastic, it is easliy one of my favorite soundtracks of any game out there (Just listen to Floral Fury, Railroad Wrath, or Murine Corps). Each of the songs is done in a 1930s style and each one is memerable in its own way.But this game has a few problems, for one thing, it has A TON of glitches. For example, the final boss has 3 diffrent glitches one of which will let the player completely skip the final half of the battle, or what about the glitch in two player mode where if one player dies then you can't get past the first form without getting stuck in the form transition. Another problem with the game is that when they ♥♥♥♥ up a boss, they REALLY ♥♥♥♥ it up. For example, More than half of Hilda Bergs attacks have no warning or when they do it still isn't enough to know to dodge it (An example is her light ball attack, where I know it can't spawn on the far left but i still dont know where the attack will start.) King Dice also sucks due to the fact that he can take over 7 min to be and his final form is him repeting the same attack over and over which have very awakward hit boxes and are super hard to dodge without getting hurt.Over all though I had a ton of fun with this game and i hope that some of these problems get fixed and I really hoping for some sort of DLC or expansion pack.  8/10

TheDaBombs	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDaBombs/	If you like to be challenged, this is the game for you.If you don't like to be challenged, give this game a try. It is definitely worth the journey (at least where I'm at in the game currently) and the money.The game gives off this charming vibe that gives me a smile every time I start the game up. It feels unique and fresh in a sense, but gives a somewhat nostalgic feel to both games like Contra if you've ever played it, and grittier TV Cartoons like Balloon Land or Minnie the Moocher.Run-and-gun games like in the old days seemed to always be challenging. This game is no exception. The platforming levels test your abilities to quickly react to enemies coming onto the screen or to watch each corner of the screen in case of any flying projectiles that fly toward your direction. To top it off, the bosses (although some are a trial-and-error scenario) are very creative when it comes to their mechanics or how it tries to challenge players. One boss manages to be a duo where they trade off punches and enemies until one of them turns into a literal fan and the other throws deadly balls at you. Another boss has UFO's flying over your head with lights that damage you while shooting stars that hurt go toward you at the same time. Although the gameplay can be frustrating and irritating, the pay off of completing a run-and-gun platforming level or one of the bosses is very rewarding and worth it in the end.Aside from gameplay, there are different items that you can get that can help you through these levels like the Smoke Bomb (which I use personally) and the Scatter Shot. It helps you get through levels a bit quicker or safely, and you can always change it if you go back to the main map.One glance at the visuals of the game and you'll instantly think of those older cartoons that you used to watch as a kid, or of Disney movies that you may have seen in the past. Audio in this game solitifies that feeling as it pays homage to the old styles of music and effects you may have heard in those same cartoons. Everything about the game screams bright, colorful and creative. From the normal flower enemies on the first platforming section of the game to the insanely creative Boss Phases, the inspirations the game draws from older cartoons helps mold its own creative, gritty identity.TL;DR: The game is difficult yet very, very enjoyable. It is filled with great platforming levels and great boss set pieces. The audio and visuals are stunning and take inspiration from older cartoons which is refreshing to see.Although I haven't beaten the game yet, this game is a blast, and I hope to continue playing it for many days to come. Definitely worth it for the price tag it has. Hopefully some day soon I'll find someone to play Couch Co-op with.

To call it a "challenge" would be doing it a disservice. This game is the hardest game that either of us have ever played, but we can't stop. We have to keep going. Inch by inch, yard by yard we are making it. This isn't "Classic Rayman Hard", this is "Cuphead Hard"This game demands that you git gud, or go home, and I haven't gone home yet!

This game is bloody ruthless, but I wouldn't have it any other way.I am a huge Mega Man fanatic, so seeing a game with very similar overall gameplay to Mega Man (No, not Mighty No. 9) is very awesome, and hence why I bought it!The 1930s Mickey Mouse themed art works very well for this game, and I still can't believe this game was made by a small group of people at a Vancouver University.

【=◈︿◈=】| Palpe	Recommended	48.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rainbow90/	as the current gaming state is getting so fahked up because of buggy game, bunch of silly microtransaction and DLC's, cuphead showed up to save the gaming community and telling that there is hope in gaming community by showing how care the Developers and how they made the game so flawless and pure of art.and of course you cannot make a good game without a better and remembered soundtrack aswell.....the vibe of the 30's cartoon really hits me by listening to the soundtrack, looking at the background, and the characters or the bosses thats all for now as overalli would give it 9.8  /10
My Little Omi	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025785324/	Bad things1. You need to press attack button for 10-15h. It would be 400 times better to make it autoattack2. Randomness in some bossfightsGood things - everything else. It's insanely awesome platformer.
Adronat	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adronat/	I had my doubts whether Cuphead would've been the kind of game that revolved largely around its style, but it quickly became clear that the devs really know what makes for an engaging and high-quality boss fight.So much thought was put into the bosses, consistently! The patterns are almost all of the time reasonable due to careful timing and clear audiovisual telegraphing, but damn...the amount of creativity crammed into these fights is second to none:1) Aesthetically beautiful battles, but also how the team ran with an theme and made a given boss attacks (or the way the fight unfolds) feel cohesive.2) Finding the time to cram in all kinds of gags or referential nods throughout the whole thing without it interrupting the flow of the fight or without relying on the same gimmicks.3) Fights feel fresh from beginning to end.Cuphead is a legitimately impressive game. Adding the run & gun stages and the sublime 30's jazz soundtrack is just the icing on the cake.Couldn't recommend it enough: "MUST HAVE" game.
🎁blobfish🎁	Recommended	28.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blobfishisadork/	I loved Cuphead all the way through. The game's a challenge but as long as you're using a controller, you should be good. A controller is pretty much required to play this because the keyboard controls are a bit weird and not as well handled as the controller. The artwork in this game is amazing, I can't believe that a style like this could be replicated and put in a locked 60fps. Studio MDHR definitely used their time well for the 7 years this has been in development. The art, controls, the boss design, and the amount of polish in this game is amazing. The only complaint I have with this game is Perlious Piers and how BS that level is with fish flying randomly.Edit: Just editing for the Steam Awards
DoctorWoo	Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bamfieldjames/	I haven't even played 2 hours, and I know I love this game! The style, animation, and music are amazing, and really do make it feel like a classic cartoon (like Stemboat Willy). This game is challaging, but not cheap. I don't feel cheated when I die. The bosses and levels are presented in such a way that you get given a way of taking damage, and if you learn how to avoid it early on, your golden. The learning curve becuase of this is great due to this! EASILY recommanded this game to anyone who is looking for a challanging game.
Fame-Taker	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fametaker/	Simple mechanics, difficult bosses. Each boss fight is unique, fun and challanging but not impossibly hard. Everyone saying this game is hard, it is, but it is not frustrating.

HaydenC	Recommended	28.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/memememememmemeeememiegnijaeg/	I honestly have nothing bad to say about this game.The bosses are literally perfect by design, and the levels are amazing.Cuphead is a ton of fun, even if you're dying hundreds of times to those stupid projectiles you see out of the corner of your eye. The music is literally perfect, and so is the art. Speaking of the art, it's f*cking amazing. Some of the best artwork I've ever seen for a video game, and I've been playing games my whole life.When this was announced, I thought it would be one of those pretentious indie games at an incredibly high price point. However, Cuphead is humble, and it respects you. It's only 20 dollars too, and that's a steal. Honestly, I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth. Had the game only been the length of the first world, I would have been satisfied. But nope, it keeps going, and it kept making me happier and happier.It's not about the money or length, though, because Cuphead is art, plain and simple.Get this game, PLEASE. The developers sold everything and gave up a lot to make this game happen. In doing that, they made one of the best 2D games I've ever played.
Twilight Shadow	Recommended	27.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TwilightShadow1/	At a rate of about 100 deaths per hour, my brother and I are slowly progressing through this game. To call it a "challenge" would be doing it a disservice. This game is the hardest game that either of us have ever played, but we can't stop. We have to keep going. Inch by inch, yard by yard we are making it. This isn't "Classic Rayman Hard", this is "Cuphead Hard"This game demands that you git gud, or go home, and I haven't gone home yet!

Berto	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/icekimi/	Marvelous and charming visuals emulating the look of 30's cartoon, but other than that I didn't really enjoy it. I don't particularly like run n' gun games, I have slow reflexes and don't really know how to play them. Loved the look, but that's all. Still, for fans of the genre it should be good, at least it looks very competent on the gameplay side of things.

Krsman	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/krsman/	5/5 This is a must play for the lovers of oldschool games and people alike. It punishes you but you keep playing because you feel very rewarded at the end. This game is GOTY material in every way.The only grudge I got against this game is because it lacks more platforming levels. I understand that the coins you get from these levels are used to buy upgrades, so if we had more of those levels would mean getting every upgrade in early levels, but, I just wish it was somehow better thought out. But even without more run'n'gun levels this game is a masterpiece and should be a part of every gamers library.

A Ratling Gunner	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989238546/	First off I demand to play Mugman in Singleplayer. He is awesome, so is Cuphead but I also love Mugman's design. ANYWHO. The style is flashy, cartoony and rememberable. The bosses are fun, and the soundtrack is gorgeous. The gameplay is challenging to say the least. It mostly operates on bosses guiding you to bosses that improve your actual skills while the run and gun segments are more for collecting coins to find specials, and new weapon types. The weapon types and effectiveness really depend on you as a player. While some people might find dodging and using a homing target gun good, others prefer the spread and charged shot. It reminds me of the original megaman, except instead of lives you take hits. The difficulty is akin to hitting your head against a wall, eventually breaking through and feeling like you achieved something. The 1930s Disney cartoon feel make me feel reinvigorated to try the boss again, and find more secrets on the map. The supers help, and everything has  a place. You can simply beat a boss, or try to get its soul contract at a higher difficulty. It pushes players to play better. If I had two gripes. They arent deal breakers just things that would have made bosses a million percent more fun is knowing how much damage you've done whether its cracks in a boss or a simple health bar it would make me feel like I can experiment with different weapons and see how I can knock a boss down easier. Second I want to play Mugman in Singleplayer. In any case having some cracks in a boss to show progress or a health bar would be nice but that said its a fantastic game and NEEDS to be in your library. Even with the difficulty I find the charm of the game overwhelming. 5/5

☮ GD_Anirudh100 ❤	Recommended	19.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdanirudh100/	Cuphead is a game that I was looking forward to since E3 2014 and I must say it did not disappoint. Played the game in co-op with my elder sister and it was the most fun we have had together in a long time. This game has amazing artstyle. Inspired by 1930's cartoons and completely hand drawn It's the most unique artstyle i've seen in recent games. It's fairly easy on world 1 but world 2 onwards the game gets really hard even on regular difficulty it took me and my sister (who has never played any games) more than a few retries. I love the gameplay, It's great balance between platforming and boss battles and the level design is also great.The game is hard but It's fair. The soundtrack is catchy and fits the game really well. The replayability is great. I pretty much love everything about this game there is really nothing i dislike.10/10 Gameplay10/10 Visuals10/10 Soundtrack10/10 Replayability10/10 Overall. This game imo is best enjoyed with a close friend or a sibling. If you like Platformers or Run'NGun type of games then you can buy this game without a second thought It's great even if you're playing alone.

ArtificialRaven	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/	Cuphead is a fast paced arcade-style action platformer with a fantastic early 1900's cartoon art style and soundtrack. It sports single player & local co-op 2 player modes. Boasting some of the tightest controls I've ever felt in a 2D action platformer and subjectively some of the best looking authentic hand drawn animation in gaming, For me just the spectacle was worth the price of admission.  While difficult, the game consists of numerous boss fight stages and 6 platforming stages spread over the course of 4 worlds.  With the uber responsive controls, varied weapons, super moves and charms the player can purchase, the player is given all the tools needed to be succesful. Failure strictly lies with that of the player and not the game. It feels punishing but fair. So one must practice, practice and practice. Besides the boss & platforming stages there is a small, linear world map to explore with NPCs, shortcuts and hidden goodies along with a shop to spend your gold coins in to purchase upgrades.  Once you've defeated the bosses of each world you're allowed to move on to the next ultimately facing off with the Devil at the end. There are special unlockable color & sound modes for completing hidden objectives, such as beating all the Run 'n Gun (platforming) stages without killing a single enemy. And for getting a perfect grade on all platforming and boss stages. There's even an expert mode if players complete the game on Regular difficulty. The achievements will also feel satisfying and well earned.Is this worth the $20 USD price tag? I sure thought it was. My only regret was not buying the Deluxe Edition with the soundtrack. The game is short but sweet. Quality over quantity. That's it for my mini-review of Cuphead, thank you for reading.

TwiliSailor	Recommended	10.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TwiliSailor/	One of the better platformers to grace the steam store. The artstyle and soundtrack is sublime plus gameplay feels rock solid. If you're looking for a challenge, Cuphead delivers in spades. The old-school style difficulty means every boss feels like an obstacle to overcome. It's such a joy when you finally master and defeat them. The platforming levels are rare, but designed in such a way that each one feels unique and fresh. A controller is recommended. This game needs mulitple quick inputs that keyboard users may find slightly difficult to pull off. It's short, tough and maybe a little frustrating but you'll rarely find a game with such charm. It's worth every minute.
AisForAbsurd	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198824936292/	Another low effort review. There is nothing I can add to the pile of positive reviews about this game. 10/10 would die and retry again.
-rtn	Recommended	1,603.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ntr-/	The game looks great. Really gives you a feel of a 30's while still maintaining the difficulty of a new game. Definitely worth the pickup. Very unique style and simple mechanics make this game easy to pickup, but hard to master. If you find yourself struggling, don't worry, push through and the rewarding feeling you receive from finally beating a level is on the same level of beating a Dark Souls boss that you've been stuck on for ages.

pezy	Recommended	266.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pezy/	I highly recommend Cuphead, but there are a few considerations you should make before purchasing it. First of all, I would definitely recommend to use a controller for this game because it's already hard enough and using a keyboard just makes it that much harder.This is a bullet hell platformer where you should expect to die a lot, especially when you are first learning the patterns of the different bosses and levels which take lots of time and effort to master, and a lot of the time you still mess up even when you know exactly what's about to happen.The game mostly consists of boss fights, there are a few run and gun, side-scrolling levels with the same feel as the boss fight levels but personally, I do not enjoy them as much. the art style and animations are just amazing and definitely make the game more entertaining and just fun in general. The music/soundtrack is also fabulous and fits with the gameplay and mood perfectly. In conclusion, there is already tons of hype about this game and you have probably already decided if you want to buy it or not, but I just recommend on picking it up and seeing if you enjoy it and if not you can always refund it. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a very difficult but also satisfying gaming experience.

Ragnarrok	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/magna_ragnarrok592/	Amazingly good platformer with the visuals and sound of a 1930's cartoon.It's also more difficult than Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. 
F00dCHAiN	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TopOfTheF00dCHAiN/	Devs did a really good job making the graphics look like 1930's art style. But don't let the cartoon-ish looks fool you, the game is way difficult and challenging, which also makes the game super fun. Cuphead is most probably the best platformer of this year.

BludStanes	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bludstanes/	The attention to detail in this game is astounding. Even if you absolutely hate the gameplay, I think just about any rational person can admit this is a good looking, good sounding, and most importantly good playing game. Like the game Furi, it's boss centric. There are a few run and gun stages, but they are very sparse and are there mainly for coin grabs (way to buy new weapons and upgrades,)a bit of practice and a good way to try out new builds and also of course a few hidden little achievements and other secrets.I haven't been able to play this coop unfortunately because it's local only, and the kind of people I hang out with take one look at this game and laugh. (This is not a diss towards the game, it's towards my friends; apparently if there isn't realistic blood and gore in the game, it's automatically a children's game.) Now, you can be like me and intially dismiss the reviews saying how hard it is. I mean, come on, the first place I decided to click on was a boss fight against a bunch of (beautifully animated) vegetables and I flew through it. At this point, I didn't realize it was mainly boss fights but I figured that out later. Anyways, I stumble my way through the first act thinking the difficulty claims were exagerrated until I hit the second wave of bosses. Let me clarify this by saying Yes, they can be very challenging, yes, even when you learn their attacks one mistake can make you end up at the very grueling begining, and yes, it's all fun and worth it. My last not very well put point would be that the difficulty usually feels very fair, it USUALLY feels like it's your mistake or your slip up. But. Sometimes the parry. It's a great idea but sometimes seems almost.... not quite but almost lazily implemented. I get that it's risk vs reward, but many times hitting a succesful parry knocks you right into getting hit. The way parries are thrown out seems too arbritary. Sometimes you know they're coming othertimes they just come out and on instinct you nab it only to be thrown in an impossible situation. Sorry for going on a tangent here, none of this affects the overall quality of this game.Boiled and distilled down to pure gameplay: The hardcore players will find much to love here behind the unforgiving bosses and liberal secrets peppered throughout.The casual will also find much to love here albeit in the "Simple"/more casual mode. You'll still get tons of bang for your buck, and hopefully playing through the shortened boss battles on simple will motivate you to come back and attack them again normally. For quite a few, I believe it will.TL;DR I'm going to edit this and make it a much better review as soon as I sober up in a few days, until then, this is a Modern enhancement of classic gameplay taking from even more classic animation and music, a big tight amalgation of retro infused lightning quick battles against gorgeously animated enemies that have more personality in a couple petals than most bosses nowadays have in their entire presentation.

Jevil is a Dimentio ripoff	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064900022/	===============================================Cuphead is a beautiful and diffcult plattformer that can be playedeither in singleplayer or local co-op.The Game looks like a old cartoon (which i personally love)and the soundtrack is amazing.The Bosses are all different from one another and they are all good and enjoyable.The "Run and Gun" levels are also set in completely different areasand are all fun to play.However i cant recommend this game to casual players at allsince even the lowest "simple" difficulty is quite a challenge.The bosses themself are also sometimes completely luck basedbecause of cupheads awful rng system.Overall tho if you want a beatiful,slightly luck based and challenging adventure with an amazing soundtrack then this is your game.===============================================

「ṨҜץץ」	Recommended	91.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skyysostupid/	Cuphead is one of my favorite games of 2017, and maybe even of all time. Theis game consists of 6 Run n' Gun stages, 3 Mausoleum  stages, and 19 Boss figthts and is definitely worth the price. While I still have to complete the game (I still have a few soul contracts and Inkwell Hell to defeat before I complete the game), it's been a joyride from the times I've played and even nearing the conclusion I'm having fun. The game is really challenging, even to some extent too challenging sometimes, and will take a lot of time up. The art style is gorgeous and the music is one of the best this year!! So if you have a lot of free time and are good at multi tasking (You're gonna need it for some of these battles) I do highly suggest it. Cuphead is truely and amazing game.

Even more fun is when you go back and try to perfect your run. The first hour I spent playing Cuphead I spent trying to get a perfect score on the first boss. I haven't even done anything else yet. It's an amazing and visually stimulating game. Just get ready to want to throw some hands when you lose for the 5th time in a row. Controller reccomended.

TheAngryEngie	Recommended	34.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAngryEngie/	Holy crap the developers of this game nailed the art style and music right on the head- The little story/explaination at the start was written well and was executed well- Cuphead and Mugmans designs are very well detailed and look amazing- Each boss being completely different to the next, the fights felt epic and challenging (dont listen to the people who say the game is very hard, I know this game isnt aimed at everyone but dont get me wrong its hard but its not like dark souls hard, just a little note to not turn your nose off from buying the game)- The music is sooooo good, I would highly recommend buying the ostThe Devs have mastered the art style, music and just everything elseITS JUST SO GOOD BUY IT :D

The Will Davis	Recommended	5.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198196773614/	Hard as balls, but in a fair way. This is the type of game that throws me back to childhood when I couldn't beat hardly anything on the NES either.
thicc fella	Recommended	22.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081697064/	ive put 23 hours into this game and i love it. it has its flaws, like bugs that make you take damage from nothing, but its addicting. its nothing like Dark Souls, even though that is something that is commonly heard about Cuphead. Cuphead is difficult, but not unfair. The bosses are mostly predictable, and the ones that aren't don't have much variation. If you want a challenging game with amazing graphics then you should definitely buy this game.

Jerry Seinfeld	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sadocehic/	it's a cute cup game
Mooglemuffins	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/edenvale15/	Right from the start I will say this game is very difficult, and may not be your thing. If you enjoy trying, trying, and trying again for hours to try to beat something and get that rush when you finally do, Cuphead is right up your alley. I hate to say the cliche of it being like Dark Souls, but it is like Dark Souls. You will die, a lot. You will be a hairbreadth away from beating a boss and die, a lot. But when you finish this masterpiece of a game you will look back and it will be time well spent.The artwork is gorgeous, 1930's animation has never looked better than here. The music is spot-on and swanky, you'll love jamming to these crafted jazz tunes time and again on your quest to success. The story, while pretty simple, is engaging and fun. The variety in the bosses is top notch, you'll be adjusting your strategies all over the place to try to survive. It was a long wait, holding out for this game to finally arrive but this is one game that lived up to and exceeded every expectation. StudioMDHR deserves all the success they get from this. 10/10 recommendation.

joelgrayus	Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198140619745/	I recommend this game... with a massive HOWEVER at the end.I am a casual gamer at best and I went into this game thinking "Oh a cute little platformer, how hard could this be??" Oh my sweet sweet child how wrong I was. The Diffculty is PUNISHING. If you're someone like me who has the reflexes of a dead walrus, be prepared to die a lot. If you're someone who isnt a total idiot and has decent reflexes be prepared to die.. A LOT. This is essentially the dark souls of Platformers. I had only played about 80 minutes of the game when i realised that i wasnt go to go very far before I abandoned this game completely. And so I got a refund. Before you jump down my throat hear me out! Like i said i am a casual gamer at best. This game is only for hardcore platform fans and those that have half decent reflex skills. Highly Recommend if youre one of those two sorts, If youre a casual gamer like me. Stay away. You will break your controller or keyboard in frustration. I know i did
Barb117	Recommended	7.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198303718513/	Really fun but really hard really satidying when you kill a boss
Crash Valentine	Recommended	11.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dew00trulz/	Cuphead is truly DARK SOULS of 2DJust kidding, that is really overrated term of being a hard game i tell you.In all seriousness, Cuphead is like that old games that i used to play, either it's Contra, Castlevania, Gunstar Heroes  and Metal Slug. I am a big fan of run and gun arcade style genre and this game is bit no different than it is. Personally i didn't find it hard, I find it very challenging, fits my CUP right away.Pretty much it's a solid game with very nice visuals and very nice musics, great gameplay.Also i played this blindly without giving into the hype and my expectation is low as hell. Worth the experience i gotta say.9/10

Scotticus	Recommended	75.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrscotticus/	I am not typically big on games with platforming elements, but I decided to give Cuphead a try based on recommendations from a friend. Cuphead quickly became one of my favorite games.Each boss fight is satisfying to complete, and there is the continual motivation to get even better at the game. Every time you die, it feels as though it's your fault, not the game's, a trait that is crucial to making challenging games such as this fun. The controls are tight and fluid. The gameplay mechanics feel well-designed and satisfying.The art style, music, and sound effects are all phenomenal. Everything is beautifully done.If you enjoy challenging games, Cuphead is well worth every cent.

TETRO	Recommended	69.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TETROYT/	This game is evrything I've been waiting for! It looks good, sounds good, and has really fun bosses. The animation is also really smooth and well done. If you're into platformers and boss fights, this is definitely the game for you. If you rage a lot, then maybe give this game a pass, as some bosses are really hard.Overall, this game is really fun to play, and the developers have clearly put a lot of work into each boss, making each one stand out. I'm so satisfied that I would even pay more for this game. Definitely worth the very long wait!

tincant	Recommended	81.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tincant/	This game is great, and I wasn't surprised by it the very second I bought it, i've seen too much on this game and had to buy it, and here I am now, a little upset that the game is beaten and theres no new content in the game, but I still like replaying some levels and bosses, and it's so satisfying after hearing that "Knockout!" audio clip, knowing that you finally got past that GOD DAMN DR KAAAHL (or any other level/boss you got stuck on if you somehow didn't get stuck on Dr. Kahl)...anyway it's a great game, and i'd say why not stop by for a buy on this pretty fun guy of a game.
Master of Puppets	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AliceMargatroid/	It's been about 10 years since I've seen a game with this much heart and soul poured into it. Everything about Cuphead is great, all the way from the style to the gameplay.Pros:Incredible style with well done animation. It definitely sticks to the 1930's-esque art style.Absolutely glorious soundtrack. I didn't hate a single song in it. And like before, it fits the theme, being new-age style jazz.Gameplay is difficult, yet fair. There's next to nothing I encountered that wasn't able to be expected or caught.Story is straightforward and simple. There's no overarching parts, it's just how it should be.Cons:Occasional glitches that have caused a death or two. While infrequent, it still was a bit of a nuisance in some situations.Later bosses start to drag on for too long, making it more frustrating to lose to them and start from the beginning.The devs of this game absolutely devoted themselves to this game and it shows. It is a solid 9.5/10, higher once the glitches get fixed. StudioMDHR, you have my support.
Beamex	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Beamex/	This is a difficult game to recommend to just anyone, and there are a few things you should consider before you drop $20 on this beautifully animated and composed platformer. First thing to mention is it is rediculously hard. A player of average skill will struggle with the first few stages of this game, and if you don't handle repetitive deaths well and starting from the beggining each time, then you will want to reconsider buying this. If you are below average at games, or just platformers in general, you'll for sure want to look elsewhere as you simple will not get much value for your money.Second thing needed to know is it is "heavily focused on boss-battles" according to the steam description. I feel more needs to be said about this because it's pretty much a boss-battle game, with a very small amount of platformer levels throw in. Essentially you begin a majority of level fighting the boss and that's it. If you're expecting something like Megaman, this is not that.After all that being said, if you're still interested, then I recommend you buy this game. It brings the same sort of challenge you would expect from games like Wings of Vii, IWBTG, and Boshy. All the bosses are very unique and bring new challenges, and the controls are spot on. The parry system takes some getting used to but is very fun to use and feels great when you land them properly. There is a rating system which brings simple, classic replayability that old school gamers will enjoy, aswell as 2 player coop.My only complaint so far is how the difficulty scaled during my normal playthrough. I found that the difficulty went up very sharp towards the end of world 2, which is ok, but it dropped off at the end of world 3 and all the way towards the end of the game. Based on some world 2 bosses taking me an hour+ to beat I was expecting the final few bosses to take me days to beat, but instead they took me maybe 20 minuites each. I'm hoping expert difficulty is different.Super fun game though.
B16B34R	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046128011/	This game is one of the most talked about games of the year. I am certain that you have heard or read about this game. If you haven't, you have been living under a rock. Considering its fame - or some would argue, infamy - my review of Cuphead will without a doubt drown in a sea of others. So I write this out of pure formality, and if nothing else than to confirm what you already know. Let me say that the stories are true; Cuphead is one for the record books. This will go down as one of the most heroic genre revivals in gaming history. Also, it has local co-op all the way through the campaign, which is the only reason I'm reviewing this. Be warned, do NOT attempt this game unless you are in a happy, fulfilling relationship. This will test your patience. The result of a drunk one night stand between Walt Disney and Metal Slug97/100
Jayrab	Recommended	13.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shurkan/	Cuphead is a brilliant game.I'm not going to go into much detail about the art style and music because there's not much that I could say that hasn't already been said by others. I enjoyed both of these aspects of the game, but what sells it on top of everything is the gameplay.Cuphead is a challenging game, but what fascinates me the most is that eventhough it stays consistantly challenging, the game never felt frustrating or aggravating! I never felt like "rage-quitting" the game, because eventhough there were bosses that I had to retry 20-30 times before I could properly nail them down, I still had fun. With every time I retried a boss, I felt like I was learning something new, figuring out new ways on how I could beat a certain stage even faster than before. This constant feeling of re-evaluation and improvement is what kept me afloat. And at the end it truly felt like I deserved to beat the game.A lot of games now a days are too eager to just hand you your victory. This one makes you work for it and it pays off in the end. I just felt satisfied playing through the game.I've played through it on Regular difficulty in ~9-10 hours. After that, there's still more challenges for you, like beating the game on Expert or playing through each stage without killing an enemy. For such a cheap game, there's a lot of content to be had.I can't recommend this game enough, especially for people that like this sort of bullet hell/run and gun gameplay.

Praga da duna	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuinhaGamer/	Cuphead is a challenging platformer that aims for an old style both on gameplay and on visuals, you see, the art style of this game is simply amazing, but I guess you have already heard of it's 50's cartoon style, after all, it's the main reason people get interested in it, I believe, but don't get me wrong, it's not your everyday mario but with an awesome art style, the gameplay is totally about learning the enemies's patterns, because of that people most judge it as an insanely hard game or even the "2d dark souls", it's not that hard, you just got to learn the patterns by the trial and error strategy. The game has a big focus on the boss fights, but it does have normal platforming levels too.So basically, Cuphead has a fun, challenging gameplay and an incredible atmosphere, and I would totally recommend it to you, mainly if you're into this animation style. However, I can't recommend it fully to you if you're too inpatient or just extremely bad at skill based games, because you will mostly have a very hard and frustrating time, however, that was not the case for me and I can say I had a great time with this game, so yeah, I recommend it
gook	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/punjistix/	Truly the Dark Souls of platforming tutorials.
Xuchilbara	Recommended	63.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ryukthecreep/	Cuphead is a great game, a wonderful piece of handwork and a great homage to old-school gaming. It delivers a fun, demanding yet rewarding experience that cannot leave anybody indifferent thanks to its amazing art direction, animation and exquisite soundtrack. So it's all good, right? Well, not really...Lemme say that Cuphead's gameplay is very solid and the way it has been filled with references and homages to old classic games - like Super Mario, Megaman and Contra - is further proof that the developers know well what good game design is about. However, there are some flaws here and there that can be quite annoying, especially if you're trying to get perfect ranks. For instance, some levels like Perilous Pliers or bosses like Beppi the Clown involve a significant amount of randomness in attack patterns, which can often lead to situations where is nearly impossible to avoid getting hit. Another problem can be found in the way certain elements in the foreground are placed, which sometimes partially obscure visuals thus creating an utterly artificial and obnoxious obstacle for the player. Level and boss design is generally good, sometimes remarkable, aside for one big exception: Rumor Honeybottoms (aka the honeycomb boss). A vertical scrolling level where you are constantly being forced to jump off-screen and where 90% of the times you get hit are from something you cannot see, is just something I didn't want to find in a modern game. Especially not in a game like this.A minor complaint I have is about the "Simple" difficulty: personally I don't care about it because I always play levels on Regular or Expert, but from what I saw it seems rather pointless since you can beat bosses but it doesn't count them on your list, thus preventing you from finishing the game. I think that's just unfair for many people that want to try an accessible mode but ultimately find themselves cut off near the finishing line. If you want to include an easier difficulty you either do it properly or you don't do it at all.Another minor thing that bugs me is about the "Pacifist" rank in run n' gun levels: I think that there should have been separate rankings for completing a level with an A+ and for completing it with a P. As it is, the game considers the P ranking the highest so it's pretty useless to sweat your♥♥♥♥♥trying to get an A+ when you can just go straight for a pacifist run. That's rather nonsensical since when you're doing a pacifist run you don't have to worry about time, damage or parrys, hence it's much easier to do so than to make a perfect run.Finally, bugs: there are quite a few as you can see from the discussion thread in the forums, but I personally never found gamebreaking ones. The fact that there hasn't been a single patch since the release is not comforting though, and I hope that the devs will fix some issues that are currently preventing some people from playing the game.To conclude, I know I might sound quite critical in this review, but believe me when I say that this game is absolutely amazing and that I love it with passion. It's exactly for this reason that I wanted to highlight its weak points instead of just praising it, 'cause I think that StudioMDHR guys have the potential to make even more amazing games in the future and I really want them to learn from their (overall few) errors. That said, I highly recommend everyone to play this gem, enjoy it and let yourself be amazed by the crazy world of Cuphead - even if that means you'll have to swear to your monitor a bit. It will be worth your while.

nspring314	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nspring314/	In terms of pure presentation, I cannot think of another game in 2017 as wholly confident and as singularly driven as Cuphead.  The animation, the art, the music, the film grain, the sound editing, the sounds themselves, hell, even the font, everything feels straight out of 1930s cartoons.Well, everything but the gameplay.  That's the stuff of the 80s, without question.  With wicked attack patterns, reflex-hounding quickness, and a pitiably shallow health pool, its difficulty is all but guaranteed to make your heartbeat syncopated and thready.  Any error could put you back to square one.  But inch by inch, perhaps even unbeknownst to you at the time, you learn the patterns, find your openings to counterattack, and suddenly, somehow, you go from dying in the first minute to passing with an A-rank.  It's nothing short of miraculous.You need this game.

Slam Jam Sam KABLAM	Recommended	39.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198411891614/	Now, let's get this out of the way first of all. This game is hard. VERY hard. So if you like more casual games I would not recommend this game. However, if your fine with difficulty, this game is amazing. The visuals are amazingly accurate to the old cartoons they emulate. The big band style music is catchy and great. The game controls incredibly. I have only found several glitchs through out my whole play through. On the subject of the difficulty, as hard as the game is, I've found that the game forces you to get better at the game. I have only found one major difficulty spike, but then again, the whole game is hard. To put it simply, I love this game. Please support these devs. They did a great job.

Dels Kibara	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dangantg/	Cuphead brought back the elements of difficulty in games and oh boy did they bring it back.While I personally didn't find it too difficult myself, having watched the boss patterns on Youtube videos, I definitely would've had trouble the first time I play this game had I not watched those boss patterns before.Cuphead is challenging, but in a rewarding way.It beats you up because it wants you to succeed.And if you fail, it's fine, there's a consolation prize in the form of a rhyme.Whether you like difficulty or not, I can safely say that playing Cuphead was one of the most adreneline filled experiences I've ever experienced.Good show. Bloody good show.

Morse	Recommended	15.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/	Cuphead is an incredible Boss rush style game with some platforming elements and sections. The biggest appeal and the reason why there are so many eyes on this game is due to its art direction, which is incredible. Every boss, every background, every enemy matches the early 30's cartoon style really well. The music is also incredible and thats something I don't think is mentioned enough.The difficulty has been talked about a lot and yes, it is hard. It can take several attempts to beat a difficult boss or level sometimes, and if that kind of thing really puts you off, definitely stay away from cuphead. I for one, love it. I get very frustrated sometimes but the difficulty for the most part is fair. I only wish the first super ability gave you a few iframes after, but its not a huge deal. My only other complaint with the game is I feel the run and gun sections just aren't as fun as the boss levels. Honestly, if these were left out, and there were 2 extra boss fights per level, I think the game would be even more incredible. As is, cuphead is still an incredible game, and for 20 bucks, is absolutely worth it.

Besides being cool, it's a Run'n'Gun Game, with pretty hard bosses. Btw, already said thatthe game is the new Dark Souls ?

Wolfzeit	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/srwolfzeit/	The music and art in this game are EXCELLENT, has a great handmade job, without a doubt. If we remove these two things, it's a game that's fine.Most of the things you buy will not be used throughout the game, you will almost always use the same.It's a bit short and once you get used to the controls it's not that hard (apart from some random things in bosses fights), you will find it more difficult if you are not used to games of this genre. You have to learn the patterns and have patience, it's a fun challenge.Despite these things that I have said, I like it and I would recommend it.
Asta	Recommended	4.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Riconz/	Do you hate yourself? if Yes get this game! because it will make you happy verifing that you do hate your self.If no, GET THIS GAME, then it will turn into a yesThis game is great, hard as balls. THE END~~~~~~~Actual review~~~~~~~OK, the art style is nothing like the other games that you see. It's not 4k HDR or anything. It's just pretty, it's styled after the old timey cartoons. But with a fresh twist making the art style it's own. 9/10 graphics.The story is very simple. You make a deal, and loose it and do what the devil says. You get money from completing levels allowing more powers to make life a little better. But don't worry, you'll never find your self bored with the levels. It ramps up difficulty in a amazing way never making it easy on your first run (maybe more if your me). The story is simple, But it's not bad having a simple story, that's not how the game is, it's not centered around story.The reason this game is truely great is the gameplay. As stated earlier, this game is hard. to a point where taking breaks will actually help. And the weapons are very interesting. This game truelly feels like it's own game, and not a clone or heavily based off anything. Everything is built from the ground up, and you can tell. Even if you put 10 minutes into this game. You just know, from the controls, to the first level you play. This game is also great if you have freinds. Something I do not.score:9/10

Although it can be brutally difficult at certain points, it doesn't stop it from being a fun game. What I like the most about this game is how the graphics and music represent those old cartoons that were black and white, for me this gave me a mega man vibe which i really enjoy so i give this game a 9.4/10 rating. Definitely worth $20

plp	Recommended	61.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/notplp/	I have never felt OBLIGATED to write a review until today.After 7 hours in (finished my first World 2 boss), I can say this game is easily one of my favorites.The early 1900's cartoon aesthetic works so well. Everything is beautifully animated, extremely charming, and fun to look at. The matching 1900's style music obviously fits very well with the game's art, it's also really catchy and fun to listen to over and over.The game has really tight controls. Shooting and dashing are very satisfying to do, especially when you pull off some cool dodge maneuver during bosses.The gameplay is mixed up by these auto-scrollish airplane bosses. I usually hate these types oflevels/fights in games but the way the bosses are designed it adds a good mix of gameplay variety and I'm actually looking forward to more of them.Albeit I've only played about 3 of them, the platforming levels in this game so far are fantastic. A great mix of shooting enemies and precision platforming make for some very satisfying gameplay.Bosses are very nicely varied in terms of design and gameplay. Even though you kill them all the same, they all feel unique to play because of how their attacks force you to play completely different each time.The difficulty of the game is extremely well balanced. I would get to a new boss, get my♥♥♥♥♥BEAT, then in about 10 minutes learn the patterns and pull off the fight. Every death I've had never felt like it was the games fault but my own. Going for an A+ (and eventually S) on levels adds a ton of replay value (hence most of my time being spent in World 1).I cannot stress enough how amazing this game has been. If you like platformers or shoot-em-ups, PLEASE buy this game. Everything about it is so well done and it's extremely fun and addicting.TLDR: Cuphead is great, buy it.

fred	Recommended	6.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FrederickthePferd/	Absolutely love this game. One of the best platformers as of late and i very much recommend you pick it up, althought it can be insanely hard at times. Prepare to rage, and scream at the annoying enemy's you will encounter in this game. With all that said, at the end of the day, I end up laughing at the game for the excelent look and feel of it. Music is amazing and the satifaction of defeating that boss that took forever to beat is great.One thing i would add is Online Coop. Would love to play with my steam friends. 9/10. Missing that one thing.

scoi007	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/scoi007/	Ugh, Cuphead is so well put-together, it makes me jealous. The hand-drawn art, the wonderful animation cycles that provide both luscious visuals and great gameplay hints, the original soundtrack that somehow feels nostalgic the first time you hear it – it all works and works wonderfully.Is it any wonder that my kids love watching me play Cuphead? There are times when I’m playing when I kind of wish I could set my controller down and just watch what’s happening.Which I can’t, of course. Because I’d die. I die a lot in Cuphead and it’s OK I suppose. The gameplay is solid, but nothing I haven’t experienced before. The platforming frustrates me the most, but I’m really here for the wonderful package that challenging gameplay is delivered in.Which is enough? Maybe? There are moments when I hate it, but maybe I just hate it for being so beautiful and I’m just a spiteful little man.

Ocelot	Recommended	62.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082610824/	A very punishing game that gives the utmost sense of acclomplisment upon beating it. The art style is 11/10 and when you think about how much effort it took them to draw every single scene and animation you've gotta give them some love. The old school swing and jazz sound track is a treat to my ears, Iv purchased the sound track on itunes just to listen to it in the car over and over. Don't wait for a sale just buy it now, it's worth the full price in every way shape and form. My 3rd favourite game of 2017
coke13	Recommended	13.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AntiCrust/	Cuphead is very interesting. Its a challenge, but not as hard as some people make it out to be. The game is a  lesson in patterns, if you are good at learning how the bosses attack the game is easy, if you are bad at learning things this game will be very very very hard. The bosses are really fun, the run and gun levels are very fun. There is no true negative to the game in my opinion. The art is good and the game play matches it. The only annoyance is the one RNG boss in the game (the dragon on world 2). Other then that boss the game is a 10/10 but because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG of that boss it gets a 9/10.

HunterXCooL	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hunterxcool/	This game is freaking epic... I need more of this fantastic experience playing thisPROS :Very unique bosses that is hard to beat and fun to replay over and over and over again... Every time you died you're gonna say "ONE MORE" lol...The feeling you get when you finally see the "Knockout" word at the boss that's been pounding you over and over again is extraordinary LOL... you will probably laugh and scream with joy... We did :)The devil is not to be underestimated with... It actually the only boss that makes my blood boil... and the feeling when we actually beat the crap out of him can't be described properly LOL Co-op is FUN AS HELL... you will laugh, scream, yell, swear and cry at your friend ROTFL... it's an emotional roller coaster to begin withCONS :I bought this game because so many people saying that it's "HARD" but TBH the bosses are not as hard as my expectation just challenging enough to be fun... The devil is the only exception though LOL...Please scroll up and buy the game... It's not that pricey for this amazing game
Ziberian	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziberian/	Great game. Really unique bosses/levels with tons of fun! Important Note:There is an issue where sometimes you open the game and your save files are completely wiped (happened to me after electricity went out), so I highly suggest not rage quitting with ALT + F4 or anything.

Ceo of Thicc Nibbas Inc.	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198345888703/	This game is very challenging for anyone that has the nerves not to rage quit after losing on the second level (like I have). The keyboard key binds are garbo so I recommend changing them, although a controller would be ideal. I love the graphics and its the little things that make a game great such as every time you die the music slows. If you do the little things right, the big things take care of themselves.
cassidy	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198260391424/	Pros:- Beautiful visuals and smooth animation. Very distinct and stylish.- Fast and responsive gameplay. Controls and plays like a charm.- Crazy and creative bosses. You always want to see what will be at the next phase.- Challenging, you need to spent some time to learn bosses patterns and get accustomed to them. But you have a feeling of accomplishment after you finally defeat a boss.Cons:- Some situations are random based and it will be impossible to avoid damage.- In some fights foreground blocks you view.Verdict - 9/10. Buy even without discount.
tasperk	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tas99p/	And here we have another example where indie studios are outshining these triple A companies and their games. So yes, Cuphead is one of the best games of this year that I've played. Game is beautiful with it's animations and characters with outstanding ost! Controls work great and feel responsibe. What about gameplay? Well game is hard..really hard but rewarding (just like games should be!)
Jundacho	Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jundachi/	Its gud 
helix	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kickflipu/	I haven't played much but these are the pros and cons from what I have played so far:Pros: - The graphics are phenominal, they may not be hyper-realistic but the aesthetic they radiate syncronizes perfect with the theme of the game.- Linking with the last point, the soundtrack is just incredible. It's nothing like Undertale or Donkey Kong Country (examples off the top of my head) but each track individually resinates perfectly with each boss, run 'n gun, just walking around and even in the store. It gives a warm welcoming feel to the environments.-It's hard. It's not a game you're gonna walk through easily in less than an hour, you will rage, you will get angry - but that's the beauty of Cuphead. It isn't just going to give you generic bosses and repeat them throughout the game. A kind of short game but compact with so many different elements all captured perfectly in every single level. It's hard, but it's not just hard for the sake of being hard like, for example, Dark Souls. It's hard to constantly challenge and push the player. You won't beat every boss within the first couple tries, it's going to take you a WHILE to figure out patterns for each boss.-The developers have clearly taken time and sunken hours into every little detail you will find, and you can tell instantly. Passion and care into every single individual aspect. -The storyline, it's not the most fascinating but it's straight to the point, you know exactly what's going on as soon as you start. It also fits in well to the 1930's cartoon style, this is something I could see being pulled straight from the likes of a cartoon from Max Fleischer. Even the bosses suit that era of cartoons where people would get their heads cut off, spooky skeletons everywhere and other absurd stuff that nowadays would get slandered by the mass media for being too "offensive".Cons:-There is a bug in the 2nd stage/world on Sugarland Shimmy where when you get to the final stage of the battle, you will never progress, when you die you will be stuck and unable to finish or beat the boss. If you try on the easier difficulty you can get to the end of the final stage but you won't be able to finish. You have to start over if you get it (I have not found a solution). Is has yet to be patched. -Some of the bosses rely purely on a set pattern so it kind of takes the fun out of facing them when you easily learn the pattern, I would of liked to see more bosses that are random in the sense that there is no pattern to what they do that can be learned, therefore making it easier (if that made sense I'm not sure. That's me nitpicking, this is a reletively flawless game, you can tell the dev team have worked incredibly hard to make this game as amazing as it is, which is refreshing since most companies usually opt for more money over making a solid game (Ark, H1Z1, CS:GO).9.4/10. If you enjoy a challenge, you are bound to enjoy Cuphead. If you can I suggest buying this game immediately. You will not be disappointed.
xConsumed.by.FEARx	Recommended	9.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nevergiveuphope/	Well howdy-do-dee, folks! It's been like, what, 3 years since I decided to write a review on a game? Any game? Oh who am I kidding, you're here for Cuphead, aincha? And ever since this game's only got funny shÌtposts for the last week, let's get right into it, shall we?I rate it 10/10.Well that jumped from 0 to 100 really quick hasn't itOk, let me explain:This is a game you have to experience blind in order to enjoy all it has to give. While this review is meant to be spoiler-free, I highly encourage you purchase it right now, finish the game, and then come back here just to tell me "Jeez random reviewer, this game was pretty good!"I mean, none of you will say that, but you get what I mean.Now without furtherado- the review:What is this game? It's esentially a boss rush platformer with some run'n'gun levels added in. And of course, it has that 1930's cartoony style as its main premise. Now, why is that important...When it comes to games, GAMEplay comes first, then graphics. However, Cuphead is quite the enigma. When we talk about graphics, we usually have instant comparisons to other games in mind. But when we talk about a graphic fidelity truly unique and with no competitors on the market to this date, can we really say anything? Well I'll say something: it's fùcking beautiful.Y'see, when I was little, I always watched shows such as Tom and Jerry, Loony Tunes, and even some communist made cartoons(didn't see that one coming didja?) These cartoons were, simply put, the best. Now don't get me as a grumpy grandpa when you read this, the cartoons we have today are great!(Save for TTG) However, these are much more down to Earth than the medium that was from 80s(maybe even later) and forward that were all about these fantastic phenomenons: characters stretching limbs, turning into all sorts of present objects/items, the weak creature(a mouse, a rabbit) would always turn out victorious, that sort of thing,And this is where Cuphead just NAILS: It doesn't matter if it's based from 30's animation, it still catches what would be relatable to animation in both the world wars: a german rat in a tin can "tank", all sorts of day-to-day objects with limbs, eyes and personas, a god damn bee turning into a fokin plane bomber, the usual.And we have gone so far without even mentioning that the whole game(THE ENTIRITY OF IT) is hand drawn. Exactly as it was almost a century ago. And keep in mind this took 7 years to make(if I'm not mistaken), so that's not something everyone can do.Now enough chit-chat about the amazing graphics, what about the GAMEplay? Or actually, the story.The story is fitting, given the aesthetic and charm Cuphead goes for. You and your friend buy some lootboxes, then EA steps in and asks for one more purchase, and boom now your credit card is empty. Then EA felt sympathetic and tells you to hunt some Youtubers that owe them money and that's about it. Wait, that's not how the story goes... Ah fùck it, ye get the idea. Now how about that sweet gameplayThe gameplay is servicable and it's pretty fun. You play as Cuphead or Mugman, respectively in local co-op, in order to gather the soul contracts for EAThe Devil. As you fight bosses and upgrade stuff, you get to customize your loadout: two weapons, one charm and one ultra. There are a total of 6 charms and weapons and 3 ultras. I've got to say they all do their job well, as for the weapons they always find at least one boss's weakness, and the charms more so stay to preference. I for one found the invincible dashing to be a lot more useful than an extra life. But each to their own. As for the ultras, essentially(God I said that a lot), as you do damage, you fill up a super meter which allows you to do a charged attack with your weapon that does more damage possibly maybe I think idk. Once your super meter is full, you activate your ultra, and all 3 of them have their use in the right circumstances. Now how about them bosses?The bosses are the bread and butter of this game and ye can't deny it. There is just so much variation and creativity going around all of them, I'm almost too scared to even spoil them. Actually, I'm not even gonna. Except to say that they catch the portrayal of a 30's cartoon spot on. That's it, that's all you're getting. Now for that sweet sound.The soundtrack is pretty much entirely just jazz, so if you're a fan of jazz, you'll instantly fall in love with the soundtrack, for it is gorgeous. Do you remember when you died over and over again on Super Meat Boy but you weren't all that frustrated since the music was rocking awesome? Well yeah, just imagine that into jazz and BOOM, there's your soundtrack.Now, the difficulty... it really shows just how casualized both the AAA and indie industry has gotten. People have gone so far to call this(THIS) the "Dark Souls of platformers". As to which I have to say: Just... how fùcking dense are you? If this is the Dark Souls of platformers you clearly have never heard in your pathetic life of The End is Nigh, N++, Spelunky, that japanese pedophile game, and so many other platformers that are considered difficult from stance of gameplay. THIS is how an average game should be like, not the sort of garbage Gone Home is like, where the game plays for itself and you cannot lose. Y'all remember that asian cùntbag that calls himself journalist took him over 60 seconds to finish the tutorial? Goes to show how low we sunk, but to be fair, gaming outlets didn't have any standards to begin with.tl;dr Now to wrap up, or if you're only reading this, it's no spoiler as I mentioned it from square one that this game gets a 10/10. But why? Let me tell you why: outstanding graphic fidelity, challenging gameplay, original soundtrack and all around lots of fun to have on this indie masterpiece. Whereas games like Undertale absolutely sunk within the spam of 4 months, I don't see this receiving any hate anytime soon.This has been your round of the mill reviewer, and what are you doing, just play the game already. 
Blurk Hårddisksson	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rabarberskurk/	As a fan of SNES-era Shmups and handdrawn animation, this is as good as it gets.
zolf 💜	Recommended	5.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/okaysobasicallyimgay/	TL;DR: This game is great, buy it. But only if you want itOriginally posted by God:If you don't like hard games, don't buy cupheadThat pretty much sums up the game but anyway...(this is a review coming from a person that doesn't play a lot hard/challenging games, do keep that in mind)Why buy cuphead?Now you may be asking yourself this question, "Why would I buy it? It's another game that'll be flooded by 12 year old fangirls making horible OC's and strange people making R34 fanart?" Aside from all of these things (yes, they do exist sadly) you have to look at Cuphead another way:PROS:-Smooth Controls-Good story-Amazing Music-Handrawn art that looks amazing (I'm NOT talking about R34 OR OC's :/)-Every. Boss. Is. Different.-30 bosses.-20+ hours of gameplay, with 3 save slots if you want to play a seperate game.-Upgrades, so things get a tiny bit easier.-2 player local co-op-Full controller support (recommended)CONS:-Fanbase sucks-No online co-op (hopefully MDHR will add this)-Difficult and ♥♥♥♥ing annoyingAnyways, if you think the game is over-priced, it really isnt. So I hope I helped you make your mind up about buying Cuphead and I hope you will purchase it. Argue with me in the comments if you think I said something wrong because I know how salty people are.See ya!-zylfy :cuphead:
dq333	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dq333/	Cuphead, a game I had been keeping an eye on for quite sometime, and with great anticipation; it has lived up to all the hype!  To start, this game is absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  The animation and backdrops are straight out of the 1930's classical cartoon era, with character designs and locations that would get a nod from Disney himself.  The soundtrack is an absolute delight, matching themes and tempo to the madness encountered on screen.  This game is a scrolling shooter at heart and thank goodness, the developers decided to make it a ride that will have you gnashing your teeth while you dodge and shoot to keep your hide unscathed.  The controls are smooth, very responsive and the hit boxes spot on for this type of game.  The difficulty is obviously subjective to one's skill in shooter games.  I personally thought it was fine - fair for the most part, and most importantly, FUN!  It took me over six hours to beat on regular difficulty (93% completed), and I will definitely be going back to perfect each bout with these crazy capers.  Highly recommended.  Best 2D action in  years!
RedhNine	Recommended	13.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redhnine/	Hell yeah!This game is otherworldly phenomenal!I'm not normally interested in platformers, but I'm glad I got this one. I'm playing this blind with my sister, and oh boy, it's waaaay harder than solo haha, but since we love to overcome challenges, there's a big, constant smile in our faces xD
potato	Recommended	115.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198236815902/	It's as difficult as sleeping on christmas eve,and god damn..i love that feeling when you kill bosses.this game is..alright i'd say :T
zhekazlo	Recommended	33.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zhekazlo/	Yo, StudioMDHR, could you please fix the 2 bugs I noticed? Firstly, when playing with two gamepads, they sometimes spontaneously start vibrating with no end until you get hit the next time. Also, the progress bar on the death card in the Baroness von Bon Bon fight gets stuck in the beggining of the last phase one you reach it. It shows you in the beginning of the last phase no matter how much you hit her. I was starting to lose point at one moment.Otherwise, the game's a MASTAHHPIECE, even though I'm stuck on Bepi the Clown for now.
Zero	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AuraOfDivinity/	Product received for free
Ocelot	Recommended	62.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082610824/	A very punishing game that gives the utmost sense of acclomplisment upon beating it. The art style is 11/10 and when you think about how much effort it took them to draw every single scene and animation you've gotta give them some love. The old school swing and jazz sound track is a treat to my ears, Iv purchased the sound track on itunes just to listen to it in the car over and over. Don't wait for a sale just buy it now, it's worth the full price in every way shape and form. My 3rd favourite game of 2017
DRIP OR DROWN	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198305010968/	for anyone thinking about buying it this christmas whether its for yourself or a friend, do it. This game is amazing and has one of the best art stlyes and soundtracks in gaming history, not to mention the intense gameplay.

CruddySky	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137848593/	The 1930's visuals are great, makes me feel like I was born 87 years ago. Would totally recommend.

Fat Wizard	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/buttloop/	I have two complaints about Cuphead:1. I genuinely feel that the 20€ pricetag is too cheap for this level of quality.2. This game gave my snapping fingers friction burns when I tried to copy the protagonist.10/10 Hail Satan
horny fauxmw	Recommended	7.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckingweaboo28/	It took me an hour to pass the first level, but the important thing is that I never took a single break.Full marks for an astounding game that certainly lives up to the hype.
nick	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/9071770/	Cuphead is a hand-drawn side scroller shooter which plays just like the classics. You need to learn the levels and patterns before you can beat them and eventually you can master fights that you once thought difficult. The game also has an incredible soundtrack which I recommend you purchase because it comes with well over 50 tracks. I only wish the game had online co-op from launch and also wish you could bind things to your mouse. I played through the entire game on keyboard so if you don't own a controller no need to worry because you can complete it the classic way.I recommend you pick this title up, it's not something you want to miss out on.
quack.quack.bloobloo	Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164387651/	Its a platformer where you need to listen to audio and visual cues for incoming attacks. Dying for first few rounds is a part of  the game because you need to learn these cues for every boss. When you die it shows you far you were from finishing the boss. Whether or not this game will be difficult for you depends on how good you are at reading the cues and remembering sequences of attacks. Tip for begginers for buying a starting attack:  at your first shop there is a close range red attack on sale which shoots in multiple directions and basically acts like a shotgun. This will help lower the boss's health much faster and also easily counter homing projectiles.

Globox	Recommended	34.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorFlopper/	Now that I've finally S ranked every boss in the game on expert, I've experienced all the game has to offer and feel I can accurately recommend this game. The Good  AMAZING soundtrack. You will absolutely not get bored dying over and over to the same boss because the music is absolutely great. AMAZING visuals. The cel-shading is true to the cartoons this game was inspired from, and there are too many references to count. Fair Gameplay. With extremely difficult games such as Cuphead, the most infuriating way to die and/or take damage is from something that gives you no time to react, or is a direct consequence of RNG. Cuphead does hame some genuinely unfair RNG in a few fights (Hilda Berg phase 2 on expert, Cala Maria phase 2 were the worst offenders imo). Nonetheless, the majority of losses or damage taken leave you not feeling cheated but understanding of your own mistake. 95% of the time I took damage while trying for perfect runs I immediately realized what I could have done better. Unique fights. Every boss in the game is something entirely new that presents its own mechanics. The Bad  My only serious gripe with Cuphead was the length of it. Beating the game with A ranks on every boss on normal took only around 10 hours. Cleaning up some extra achievements took around 5, and the final ~20 were spent going for perfect runs on expert for every boss. However, the bosses are mostly the same on expert, meaning all the hours spent at this point were essentially replaying content. Why is there no achievement for S ranking all bosses? I want to brag dammit.

Slalad	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198216371156/	Cuphead more like Meaniehead
Ms. Sheep	Recommended	17.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198416969968/	Good game! Really nice style, old style, and the cool thing is that the colours of Cuphead and Mugman change, depending where you are. I really recommend this game if you're into shooting!
数分林老师	Recommended	4.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073863399/	This game is super interesting. I really love it. It's old-school, it's hardcore.

The visuals are gorgeous, the game runs seamlessly, and the soundtrack is the perfect cherry on top. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.9.8/10

Graham Crackers	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexIsBadAtGames/	Do I even need to explain this one? I like games with unique styles, and you literally cannot get more unique than this. Every single aspect of Cuphead’s presentation is flawless, due in large to the insane level of attention to detail from the developers. Yes, there are bumps in the road when it comes to fairness and difficulty, and those problems should not be ignored. But you can’t give up on it halfway through. You get the shotgun weapon, you get the smoke bomb, and you get good. Each level is a challenge from the developers, and the satisfaction you get from beating them makes all the frustration worth it.4/5

scoi007	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/scoi007/	Ugh, Cuphead is so well put-together, it makes me jealous. The hand-drawn art, the wonderful animation cycles that provide both luscious visuals and great gameplay hints, the original soundtrack that somehow feels nostalgic the first time you hear it – it all works and works wonderfully.Is it any wonder that my kids love watching me play Cuphead? There are times when I’m playing when I kind of wish I could set my controller down and just watch what’s happening.Which I can’t, of course. Because I’d die. I die a lot in Cuphead and it’s OK I suppose. The gameplay is solid, but nothing I haven’t experienced before. The platforming frustrates me the most, but I’m really here for the wonderful package that challenging gameplay is delivered in.Which is enough? Maybe? There are moments when I hate it, but maybe I just hate it for being so beautiful and I’m just a spiteful little man.

Besides being cool, it's a Run'n'Gun Game, with pretty hard bosses. Btw, already said thatthe game is the new Dark Souls ? The Dark Souls 4 ?Now stop reading this review and go buy this incredible game! 
Wolfzeit	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/srwolfzeit/	The music and art in this game are EXCELLENT, has a great handmade job, without a doubt. If we remove these two things, it's a game that's fine.Most of the things you buy will not be used throughout the game, you will almost always use the same.It's a bit short and once you get used to the controls it's not that hard (apart from some random things in bosses fights), you will find it more difficult if you are not used to games of this genre. You have to learn the patterns and have patience, it's a fun challenge.Despite these things that I have said, I like it and I would recommend it.
Asta	Recommended	4.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Riconz/	Do you hate yourself? if Yes get this game! because it will make you happy verifing that you do hate your self.If no, GET THIS GAME, then it will turn into a yesThis game is great, hard as balls. THE END~~~~~~~Actual review~~~~~~~OK, the art style is nothing like the other games that you see. It's not 4k HDR or anything. It's just pretty, it's styled after the old timey cartoons. But with a fresh twist making the art style it's own. 9/10 graphics.The story is very simple. You make a deal, and loose it and do what the devil says. You get money from completing levels allowing more powers to make life a little better. But don't worry, you'll never find your self bored with the levels. It ramps up difficulty in a amazing way never making it easy on your first run (maybe more if your me). The story is simple, But it's not bad having a simple story, that's not how the game is, it's not centered around story.The reason this game is truely great is the gameplay. As stated earlier, this game is hard. to a point where taking breaks will actually help. And the weapons are very interesting. This game truelly feels like it's own game, and not a clone or heavily based off anything. Everything is built from the ground up, and you can tell. Even if you put 10 minutes into this game. You just know, from the controls, to the first level you play. This game is also great if you have freinds. Something I do not.score:9/10

Joe_Neu_15	Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Joe_Neu_15/	Cuphead is one of the most brilliant, fun, and hardest masterpieces I have ever played. The old style of cartoons is beautiful and the OST is definitely a must-listen. I honestly love this game!
Snackel	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nimrod200808/	Amazing, one of the best looking games of all time. Frustratingly hard but very satisfying when you beat a level/boss. Worth every penny.
Dabowss	Recommended	35.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198242167102/	This game is brilliant. Beautiful hand drawn animations, addictive run and gun gameplay, and it has the most unique and imaginative boss fights you could think of. They really succeed on the whole 1930's vibe that they're going for. For sure the game's difficulty is punishing but it never comes off to me as being unfair. You just gotta be alittle resilient thats all.
just Zach	Recommended	11.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shiNybreLoom931/	This is an amazing game! I loved every bit of it, the soundtrack, the art and animation, the frustration, the humor and dark tones...just everything about it. It's a super hard game, but I never got the feeling of "I can never complete or beat this" or "it's too hard, and I don't want to play anymore." It's tough, but the feeling of beating a boss with one hit left or after fighting them upwards of seven or eight times is the real reward here. The run 'n' gun stages are kind of the only thing in the whole package that are pretty average, but I love that they're included and are completely optional. The six weapons in the game all felt unique and interesting, and the charms, while a little annoying that none of them are straight upgrades, they were still an interesting addition. Overall this is a wonderfully tough but fun as hell game. Great game feel, great art style. I'm not one for difficult games where you have to start all the way over, but this one is different. I can't recommend this game enough!
Italy during both world wars	Recommended	32.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/The-Juggerknight/	It's pretty fun.Also incredibly difficult.It's like Contra in the sense its a run-and-gun game sometimes...and the difficulty too!This game is also heavily focused on boss-battles.The game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥to hell and back, (literally!) but you'll have a good time doing it. Like you're some sort of pain-obsessed freak!Its fun. If ya have the cash, buy this game! ( note, if you don't like challenge in a game...this might not be your cup of tea.Pun very much intended.)My entire experience with Cuphead is you laughing into the face of death shortly before getting suckerpunched.

Trash Wizard	Recommended	50.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trashwizard/	Every negative review of this game is just people complaining on the difficulty because they have never been challenged before and in my opinion this game wasn't even that hard. This game was well crafted and hand drawn and it looks amazing.There  is some flaws though like the game breaking bugs like how you can make king dice just keep dancing with his fingers or the plant monster just dance and not attack until you damage him enough to get him to his final form. But these things can be fixed simply with some updates everything else is just brewed to perfection ...MMMMWAH!! 10/10 GAME BTW I never seen the game until I saw a streamer play it and just the look of the game drew me in.
NatoTornado	Recommended	15.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157100897/	Cuphead has to be one of my favourite games of 2017.

d_low	Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dlow/	Amazing game. The artwork and music are top notch. I can't imagine how much work went into making this. The gameplay itself is great if you like contra style boss fights and having to replay fights over and over to learn the phases/memorize patterns. If that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, go watch someone stream it just so you can appreciate this masterpiece.
Sorrow	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sorrow78/	The hand drawn animations and the sound track alone make this game worth the $20 price tag, but if that isn't enough the gameplay itself is amazing.

Nonetheless, the majority of losses or damage taken leave you not feeling cheated but understanding of your own mistake. 95% of the time I took damage while trying for perfect runs I immediately realized what I could have done better. Unique fights. Every boss in the game is something entirely new that presents its own mechanics. The Bad  My only serious gripe with Cuphead was the length of it. Beating the game with A ranks on every boss on normal took only around 10 hours. Cleaning up some extra achievements took around 5, and the final ~20 were spent going for perfect runs on expert for every boss. However, the bosses are mostly the same on expert, meaning all the hours spent at this point were essentially replaying content. Why is there no achievement for S ranking all bosses? I want to brag dammit.

Theo_Andres	Recommended	43.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198387421524/	THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES Lord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happpens. A KNOCKOUT! “Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”This is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet inmensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didnt just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE into it. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.The most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely reccomended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.

Dels Kibara	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dangantg/	Cuphead brought back the elements of difficulty in games and oh boy did they bring it back.While I personally didn't find it too difficult myself, having watched the boss patterns on Youtube videos, I definitely would've had trouble the first time I play this game had I not watched those boss patterns before.Cuphead is challenging, but in a rewarding way.It beats you up because it wants you to succeed.And if you fail, it's fine, there's a consolation prize in the form of a rhyme.Whether you like difficulty or not, I can safely say that playing Cuphead was one of the most adreneline filled experiences I've ever experienced.Good show. Bloody good show.

Ocelot	Recommended	62.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082610824/	A very punishing game that gives the utmost sense of acclomplisment upon beating it. The art style is 11/10 and when you think about how much effort it took them to draw every single scene and animation you've gotta give them some love. The old school swing and jazz sound track is a treat to my ears, Iv purchased the sound track on itunes just to listen to it in the car over and over. Don't wait for a sale just buy it now, it's worth the full price in every way shape and form. My 3rd favourite game of 2017
billbotics	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/billbotics/	There is a reason this game is so popular. It is damn near perfect.Pros:The Aesthetic. This alone is worth the $20. The amount of care that went into creating the sprites, backgrounds, animations, sound effects, and music is worth your money. These developers deserve more, quite frankly. If you see this on sale and you still don't have it, you should actually *wait* until it's full price before picking it up. It's that good.Perfect difficulty. Although this may be a point of contention for some, I believe difficulty vs. reward in this game is perfect. There's a simple mode that allows less experienced players have a shot at seeing most of the content. The regular difficulty is not that difficult. I'm pretty experienced at platformers, but I'm not that good. The game only took me roughly 7 hours to beat on regular on a blind playthrough. Compare that to a game like say "I wanna be the guy" and you'll find the difficulty and amount of time spent very reasonable.Variety. 20+ bosses, each with multiple phases and every single phase is unique. Not to mention multiple weapons, super powers and charms that allow you to brew your own flavor of Cuphead.Unique. I've never played an officially released game like this. I attempted to play "I Wanna Be The Guy" and failed miserably, but that game was never officially released. As far as I know, this is first of this type of game to be officially released. I could be and probably am wrong. But this was a wholly new and unique experience for me, and likely to many others who might pick this up. (Please tell me of other games if I am wrong, because I would love to play them!)Cons:Repetitive. This will flat out turn some people off. You will die many, many times in this game. You will hear the same music, play through the same boss phase, and hear the same sound effects a plethora of times consecutively. This can irritate a casual gamer, but in my opinion, that is where the aesthetic really helps. It's hard to stay mad at Woody Woodpecker stuck in a birdhouse.Casually Difficult. While there is a simple mode in this game, it will still be too much for some casual gamers. If they are not able to beat the first 3 or so levels, that's all they will see. This is true of most games, however. It just may be too difficult for your average casual gamer that may be interested in this art style/aesthetic. If you believe you are one of these people, it may be better to just watch someone play the game. It pains me to say that, but 20 bucks is 20 bucks.Somewhat short. This is a very small gripe, because it feels like there is so much content in this game. The playtime of 7 hours to casually beat the game on regular seemed a bit on the short end to me. Now, I plan on getting all of the achievements and even trying my hand at a speedrun, but for a first time playthrough, it left me wanting. This may have also been enhanced by, again, how truly unique and breathtaking the aesthetic is.I had to write a review for this game, because it's not often that a game comes along and wows you the way that this game did for me. 10/10 - An instant classic. 
Imperfection	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/imperfection9/	I think cuphead is great.  It's challenging but you can definitely get better at it. I have found myself ridiculously close to beating a boss and after all the fails its just so rewarding to win. All it takes to win in cup head is patience and remembering bosses patterns.  Try not to make too many mistakes early in a boss fight so you can save health for later surprises (cuz there is a lot of them) I have a lot of fun streaming this game for friends to watch me suffer and also like to watch their stream for the same reason. I also love the old school cartoon design and all that. Great game overall,  I hate it sometimes when I'm losing but I love it again when I'm winning.  I recommend highly

Sprong	Recommended	45.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308930442/	The game follows a cup and a mug struggling with their gambling addiction. When their gambling debt catches up to them, they try to pay for it by first destroying the local farm.And subsequently beating every resident of their isle until those residents couldn't resist the engraged cups any longer and submitted their coins and souls to the young cups. The victims included an engineer, a well-established distributor of honey, the local bakery, an astronomer and worst of all a war-veteran who got eaten in the process!Influenced by their uncle, the young cups decided to refuse to pay for their debt and severely crippled the local casino-manager. When the boys realised it wasn't enough, their raging storm of destuction hit the owner of the casino. The owner of the casino was baffled with the choice of the young cups since he made special arrangements for the cups to pay of their debt in a feasable manner.The owner and the guards of the casino did their best best to fend the cups off, to no avail. The owner was crippled, his arm was broken and his hard-built enterprise destroyed.Solid 10/10, would play it again!

Sarcaster	Recommended	40.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019935842/	Hello everyone. I rarely write reviews but I wanted to share my thoughts about Cuphead, since it's one of my favourite games by far. I just finished the game on Expert, getting S ranks on every boss levels and P ranks in every Run & Gun (platforming) levels, so I believe I have an overall idea what I want to share with you guys. Some of the things are major and others minor. Sorry if I type something wrong in English. Graphics  99% sure most of the people noticed this game because of these gorgeous graphics. And I don't blame you. Really beautiful graphics and animations. It's a really good thing Studio MDHR put a lot of effort to this for multiple reasons.Beautiful graphics and animations are pleasent to look at -> People want to advance in the game and see what else developers made.It's always clear, when boss is about to attack (animation). In these kind of hectic games it's very important to have a clear indication, that the boss is about to do something. This way boss fights are fair.Guns having a "color code" helps player to notice what weapon they are using. Also bullets have different shapes so that helps as well. Audio Absolutely fantastic and fits the game perfectly. Even a metalhead like myself enjoys these jazz tunes!Good music keeps you going, even if you have died 100 times. Controls Controls feels really tight and I really don't have anything bad to say. Cuphead does exactly what I want him to do.Default control layout can feel a bit wonky, so I do recommend changing some inputs. Gameplay It's fun, challenging and rewarding. Everything I was expecting from this gameIn "Gun & Run" levels, if you dash forward really fast and multiple times, it can change enemies' spawning time/location. This only applies for people who maybe want to speedrun the game(?)There are some glitches, but let's be real, every game got some. If you want to see one I encountered, feel free to watch this clip from my stream -> https://clips.twitch.tv/MistyHelplessSashimi4HeadHitboxes are really fair, for the most part. I only encountered one boss, who got little bit of wonky hitboxes. Here is another clip from weird hitboxes -> https://clips.twitch.tv/YawningPrettiestEggplantFunRunI would like to add, that one small glitch or one weird hitbox from one boss didn't ruin my fun with the game. Final Verdict It took me around 22 hours to beat this game twice (regular difficulty & expert getting best ranks every stage) and I like this game so much, I might start speedrunning this. It's so good game. If you are looking for a challenging bossrush game with little bit of platforming, awesome music and beatiful graphics, I recommend this game for you. 
KirinBoy	Recommended	29.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057728888/	Cuphead is like the most beautiful woman you will ever date who loves you unconditionally except for one personality flaw.Everytime she's upset with something, she kicks you in the balls.Does it hurt?

Steffe™	Recommended	13.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenWasAlone/	 Cuphead Cuphead is a boss galore with the art style from the 1930's. Positives: The art style is fabulous and is probably the biggest draw in for the people who bought this game, the art only gets better and better as you go throughout the game.The bosses are unique and have their own pattern which you must get used to in order to defeat the boss.The game isn't very long but the sheer difficulty will have you playing for hours (Even on just one boss.)The music is fantastic throughout, really making you have a little jam and sing along.There are multiple weapons and abilities which are useful... There are certain weapons which are better against specific bosses as it will match how they act a lot better.Parrying is a great way to build up power but to also not get hit off some of the projectiles from the bosses.There is a simple and regular mode which are differentiated in diffculty, but you must complete all bosses on regular if you want to get to the end zone (For story purposes).Once completed you will unlock a harder mode called 'Expert' which will truly determine how good you are at this game. I can safely say I can beat all of the bosses easily on regular, but when going into Expert mode, it's like you're starting the game again and you don't know what you have gotten yourself into.There are other unlockable modes which will really challenge you as you have to do a specific task throughout to unlock... I'll leave you to it to find out what it is ;)Co-op mode is fun and will get you to interact with others but you must both jump around on the The shop is where you buy your upgrades for your weapons and abilities and the currency is coins which you can get throughout the world or you can collect them through the Run'n'Gun missions.The mausoleums give a good challenge where you have to parry the ghosts and in the end you get a 'super' which have their own unique specialities. Negatives: When you use a super move and an enemies projectile is on you, it will instantly damage you once the super is over and gives you no immunity after using it, so it can be a hit or miss when you use it.The sheer difficulty can put people off immediately, personally I like a challenge but some people do not.The secret modes are done by going through specific levels and doing specific things but this can be extremely difficult and very frustrating.In my play through, I used all of the abilities and my conclusion was that there is only a few that are useful and the others just aren't and this is disappointing as I though I could have different kinda play styles with each ability.The game isn't long as mentioned previously which is unfortunate but the good thing is that it is very difficulty making it a longer game.I would recommend this game to anyone as the price of the game is really cheap for what it is and it will be a great experience for you to have.

Just a Festive TimeButt	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Whydidyoueventypethis/	I am rating this game good for a couple of reasons. Though I have not played much of this at all, probably not even long enough to critique it properly, I would like to state that this game's difficulty is well balanced for what type of feeling it's trying to create, the levels are well done visually and gameplay wise as well, not to mention that it is random enough to have a slightly different experience when replaying the level because of a move performed by the boss or enemies, whether it was graphically appealing or just as simple as an idle animation. Cuphead is, what it looks like so far to be, a short game with what I think is an adequete replay value ( if it wasn't, then dying so much in this game would not be as "fun" as it is. ) and, as I stated before, amazing hand drawn 1930's art style and music that almost perfectly replicates that era of cartoons. I do not think this game is for everyone, as it is ( at least to me ) a very challenging game, obviously suited for people who want to feel the adrenaline pump more than just sitting at a desk clicking away at some objects or people. The only complaints I have for this game are the occasional glitch that might force me to task manager the application off the face of my toolbar and the fact that it doesn't have options to minimalize a few things to run well on older pcs ( but I doubt that doing that would be as easy said, considering that all of it is hand drawn. ) Overall, I see cuphead as an exellent game to pick up if you enjoy an older vibe of cartoon and a 90's feeling of platform shooting games ( such as the older megamans ) with a touch of the occasional repression of rage and maybe a bit of crying, as well. ( that's if you're not too good with coordination or if you're Dean from VentureBeat. )
Tpsteel5	Recommended	80.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126602268/	I like the bit where you hit the guy
Atrox	Recommended	49.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058702996/	Cuphead may be one of my favorite games of the year. The 1930s Fleischer-esque style hooked me and the prospect of a meaty challenge only made me want to play it even more.I'll say this much, Cuphead is a challenging game, but it's not impossible or unfair. Most of the game is boss battles filled with various attack patterns to duck and weave while you chip away at the boss's health. It's easy to back yourself into a corner, but as long as you're smart about your positioning, the game always gives you a window of opportunity to avoid attacks.... it's just sometimes that window is very very small. This game will beat you down, but as long as you're tenacious and pay attention, you can only get better.Gameplay aside, the sheer amount of love and care put into this game shows in the artwork and music. Every sprite has been animated by hand tradtionally (animated with pencil and paper) as opposed to digitally (in a program like Photoshop or Flash) as seen in games like Skullgirls or Indivisible. The sprites were colored digitally to be brought into the game, but are processed in a way to give a genuinely aged film feel. There's enough gaming references to keep gamers happy (Sally's Divekicks, Ribby and Croaks doubling as a Street Fighter and Battletoads Mashup, Dr. Kahl's allusion to both Dr. Wily and Dr. Robotnik, etc), but also plenty of Golden Age cartoon references to keep the animation buffs happy. I feel like every boss, every stage has a connection to some old Fleischer, Iwerks, or Famous Studios short I've seen before, but without being carbon copies of any characters in those shorts. I can't be the only one that thought of Balloon Land when fighting Beppi the Clown. Or Somewhere in Dreamland while battling Baroness Von Bon Bon. I especially love the watercolor backgrounds, which not only reflect how backgrounds were made back then, but also make the animated characters (like you and the enemies) stand out. It's used to great effect on the overworld map, as the stages and things youi can interact with are slightly animated, appearing wobbly and lighter than other parts of the map. A great touch that works with this style but also works from a gameplay perspective. I'm still floored at how the Moldenhauers were able to make this all come together so naturally.The music is also incredible. The majority of tracks in the game are played by a full jazz band, and it hits a sweet spot between a style that suits the game's aesthetic, but also works to keep you focused on the game. The music is dynamic enough that the speed and pitch will change depending on if you use a super, pause or even die (where the music sort of dies down to a crawl). Great attention to detail. The musicians deserve as much credit as the artists.Cuphead's a great game, but it's not for everyone. Some people won't find the challenge or style all that fun or engaging. But for those who love a challenge, or are willing to go the distance to see more of the game's crazy art and animation, this is definitely the game for you.

The music is fitting every scene and sounds just perfect (The OST is worth it).But as beautiful Cuphead is, it is just as challenging. Through trial and error you learn every boss' phase and pattern, just to die right before you defeat it. It can be frustrating, but the feeling when you finally defeat a boss is very satisfying. And then the struggle begins again.The cartoon style, a nice sounding OST and very good but challenging gameplay makes Cuphead a definetly recommendable game.

With tight inputs, smooth controls and an animation style that will have you saying, "Well golly jee, that's a rootin' tootin' good time." this game is a classic in the making.I haven't played a game in some time where I died constantly and it made the exerience all the better. Map layout is great, bosses are tons of fun, run n' gun levels that are a pleasure to get down memorized. Dare I say, I felt a little classic SNES Donkey Kong Country joy in my heart.Maybe the art style is not your thing (if you're a big ol' stick in the mud), regardless, the gameplay will have you hooked (if you're any kind of actual gamer). I highly recommend it, and I haven't had a chance to yet, but I can see co-op play being the stuff classic gaming memories are made of.

Satan Claus	Recommended	40.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkestdungeonfan/	 I waited 3 years for this :')Cuphead stands out for its unique art style, which perfectly captures the aesthetics of old timey cartoons from the 1930s. It looks gorgeous, both in screenshots and in motion. We’ve been enthusiastic about it for a while.For gamers with tough reflexes forged in games like Super Meat Boy, Trials HD, or even the Contra series (or worse), the unforgiving run-and-gun boss fights of Cuphead will be a welcome challenge, leading to lots of satisfying, fist-pumping catharsis when a long string of attempts finally leads to success. For everyone else, Cuphead's awe-inspiringly detailed animation is best enjoyed in the more limited Simple mode or via the YouTube playthroughs that will surely flood the Internet in the days to come. The Good  Ultra-vibrant, screen-filling animation is unlike anything I've ever seen in a game. Game is extremely challenging but never feels unfair. Peppy jazz soundtrack will stay in your head for hours. Imaginative and highly varied character and fight design. "Simple" difficulty offers a much easier path to see most of the game's content. The Bad  Occasional obvious digital art elements can ruin the look of a scene. Overall challenge level is unforgiving to the point of controller-throwing frustration. No way to proceed to the ending if you get perpetually stuck on one particular boss. Run-and-gun platforming levels largely aren't worth the frustration. The Ugly  Dying within seconds of killing a boss, then suffering through 15 more minutes of failed attempts.Verdict: Those with a high tolerance for repeating difficult 2D shooting challenges should buy it. Everyone else should try it in Simple mode or just by watching on YouTubeOriginally posted by author: Satan Claus

Laphin Hyena	Recommended	27.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/laphin/	Wow, Cuphead... Where do I start...?  If Nintendo or SNES games were still being made today, Cuphead would be the product of what is some of the most fine game development I have seen in a LONG time.The art style, the mechanics, the music, the sounds...  Cuphead is sure to leave a lasting impression.  Bringing back all sorts of Looney Tunes, Disney, and other old animated feature nostalgia, Cuphead is something that should and probably WILL go down as a classic.I think all the developers on this team may take themselves lightly, but StudioMDHR.. if you're reading this, you've all created something special here.  There are SO many people out there that want traditional animation back.. and this team pulls it off with flying colors.  But..... there is something else you must know.THIS GAME IS HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!  You will curse..  You will have a lot of heavy sighs..  Dark Souls was born based off the classic unrelenting mechanics we all grew up with in the late 80s and 90s, where you LEARN, and then you succeed.  And that is what you will go through with the bosses in this title.I'm sure a lot of folks will try and say that this game is the 2D Dark Souls.. but these kinds of titles existed long before Dark Souls.  This dev team took the best of platforming, bullet hell, and side shooters and crammed it all together.(Keep in mind this game is sortof a bullet hell'ish game, so you'll encounter some cheap deaths from time to time!)The result is fantastic though.  So, prepare yourself.. and jump back to the 30s baby... because this game will test your skill, and the beautiful art will hold you, and never let you stop until you're done.This is Cuphead.

OhNoo Studio	Recommended	11.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OhNooStudio/	It's capturing a fallout vibe a little. Maybe becouse of the jazzy music and of course cartoons which reminds me of vault boy. Anyway the climax it's very strong with this one. Also the voices and singing are great. I'm not a big fan of the difficulty. It's just to much for my taste but I must admit it suit the game well. The boss fights are absolutely genius and I wish Mario had similar bosses some day. This game will definitely win the best graphic 2017 award no doubt.

Endyo	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/endyo/	Few things please me more in indie games than unique art styles executed well.  Cuphead leaps to the very top of my list of games that pull this off with near perfection.  But anyone would be able to derive that from a minute or two of video.  The real question is whether the game is actually fun to play, and luckily, the answer is yes – but with some hurdles for your average player.A 1930s Walt Disney Fever DreamRight up front Cuphead impresses with a design and art style that is easily described as what an artist in the 1930s would create with the description of what a modern video game is supposed to be.  It truly looks and feels like it was plucked from a strange anachronistic timeline.  The designs and animations of every character could easily be transposed into old Warner Brothers cartoons and look right at home… and man are those designs something to behold.  The main protagonists, Cuphead and Mugman (the second player’s character that won’t be around playing solo), are unique in their own right, but they end up being the least interesting thing you encounter in the game.  Bosses transform multiple times for each encounter, offering up completely new visuals to go with their new set of abilities.  The vast majority are fanciful characters from the start, ranging from anthropomorphic vegetables to some sort of Zeppelin woman that transforms into a moon for some reason, and everything in between.   That’s just in the first act.  It only gets wilder from there, but I won’t ruin the surprise trying to describe what turns out to be one of the more entertaining parts of the game.  It is actually quite easy to forget that even the backgrounds of these levels and boss fights are beautiful and have their own little animations.  I can’t imagine the effort it took in developing this to seamlessly combine the animations with the gameplay.Indie Rage 2017The gameplay is where things are going to get a little feisty.  I’ve come to realize over the years that exceptionally difficult games end up leaving me feeling a little more sour than games where progress is consistent.  Retreading content is one of my least favorite things, whether it’s backtracking in RPGs or having to restart a level or checkpoint because of something that comes out of nowhere.  Cuphead is without a doubt one of the toughest games I’ve played this year.  With most of the events in the game dumping straight into a boss fight, the game is generally referenced as a “boss rush” title, though there are optional levels that are more traditional run and gun affairs that have you blasting away at tons of weak enemies in order to collect coins.  The coins are then used at a shop to unlock various different perks and weapons that are essentially sidegrades – upgrading one attribute and downgrading another.  So you may get a weapon that has a unique attribute like a wide angle of damage, but if has a shorter range.   However, being able to carry two at a time and switch between them means you can set a loadout specific for a tough boss fight in order to make it a little easier on you.  With the game being as tough as it is, there’s not really a way to make it appeal to everyone.  I know I raged several times and even said aloud to my monitor that a particular boss or level was unfair, but every time I’ve gone to war against one of these “unfair” things, I’ve managed to overcome it to great relief.  Cuphead manages to be equal parts immense frustration and gratifying success thanks to each boss fight being a matter of minutes at most.  In some ways, it works out like Super Meat Boy with its quick turnaround, meaning even when you fail repeatedly on a boss, you end up trying many more times because it’s just a quick button press and you’re back in at the start of the fight.   At first, I was a bit disappointed that the game didn’t feature the rich and extensive level design of a game like Megaman, despite sharing a lot of the core jumping and shooting side scroll gameplay, but I found the numerous unique boss battles to be even better than those you’d find in the classic blue bomber series.  The part where I recommend itDifficulty alone wouldn’t be enough to make me hesitate to recommend this to nearly everyone.  It’s really a marvelous piece of work that just radiates its quality of craftsmanship.  I haven’t even completed the game because the frustration leads me to putting it down at relatively short intervals, but I keep coming back and wanting to make it just a little bit further to see what silly animated bits of nostalgia will be presented.  I think that it might turn off people who are not at least a marginal fan of platformers, but if you were a fan of Megaman, Contra, or any classic platformer with shooting, you’ll probably have enough experience to enjoy the gameplay and also get the treat of seeing a developer raise the bar on creativity.  I can only hope that Studio MDHR plans to make a sequel or at least another game featuring this fun aesthetic, because they really seem to know what they’re doing despite not having any previously released games as a company.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation 
cricketlenny	Recommended	20.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CricketLenny/	[EARLY IMPRESSIONS: 2 HOURS]This game is, as of this time of writing, living up to all of my expectations.The graphics/artistic direction in this game is absolutely phenomenal, both impressive and appealing to watch. They hit that retro cartoon vibe perfectly.The performance is stable and consistent, with only a few drops below 60 during loading screens during my play time.Controls are tight and responsive, although the default layout for the controller isnt the most ideal when it comes to dashes, I recommend making some slight changes to it if you think this could be an issue.Gameplay is very entertaining and decently challenging, but not so difficult that it becomes cumbersome. I at least had enough skill to make it past the tutorial without any issues, so that definitely makes this review credible, no doubt!The mechanics are remniscent of Mega Man X, but not so closely matching them that it feels like a ripoff of it.I wasn't expecting multiple modes of firing on the fly, and its definitely a nice touch.The bosses are a wonderful time, with lots of entertainly nostalgic character designs and tough but fair methods of attack.Based on my current time and first impressions, I do not hesitate to give this game a 9/10, absolutely worth your time and money.

GameZard	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gamezard/	   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Now this is how you do an indie game! Cuphead is a game that I was excited for ever since I saw a little clip from E3 2015. Now after playing it I am satisfied. As you may have noticed cuphead has a unique 1930s cartoon artstyle. The gameplay is split between boss rushes and platforming. The story is really simple like a cartoon from 1930s would be and does a good job making cuphead and mugman likable. This game is not really as difficult as people say, all you need to do is memorize movement patterns. The only con I feel the game has is that their is no animated cutscenes. This is supposed to be like a cartoon so why are the cutscenes presented like a story book? I fully recommend cuphead to anyone that wants a fun and challenging game.  
PeaseMaker	Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/peasemaker/	Like Dark Souls, but with Cups
Rickton Strange	Recommended	52.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RicktonStrange/	Best game I have played in a long time. The Difficulty was just right, not too hard to make you want to quit, but enough to make you rage a time or two. The feeling this game gave me every time i beat a difficult boss was reminiscent of slaying some of the harder bosses in Dark Souls for the first time. 10/10
Dead	Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Heavy_The_Squid/	I love very challenging games and this game is really fun i recommend you to buy this game it's 100 % worth to play it!It reminds me i am playing a disney cartoon game from the 40s or 50s. I love it :D 
Genolla	Recommended	5.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucio-Ohs/	Excellent game to play with friends or solo. It can be difficult but if you have a bit of patience and determination, this game is far from impossible to beat. You've seen the gameplay and know what it is, so I feel like there's not much to be said that isn't purely opinionated like the difficulty or appreciation of the artstyle, but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone remotely interested!
Nero Chinki	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoodGuyNero/	Despite me thinking Cuphead is a great game, there is one thing i would like to go over;Was it neccesary to make it the Bloodborne / Dark Souls of platformers? I will add to this question that i am not the greatest at platformers but the fact that this game more or less forces you to play on such a level where you can only take two hits and requires you to beat the bosses on Regular mode to get their contracts. Other then maybe a mode for people who just want to enjoy the game for what it is and at a more casual pace, there isnt much the game does wrong as i love the 1930s style animation and the soundtrack by Kris Maddigan, both wich show the amount of dedication that went into the game.In short, its a great game but could use a mode for the more casual players amongst us.
MrDeepDarkmind	Recommended	35.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrDeepDarkmind/	 The  Genre, Difficulty of CupheadCuphead is like supposed to resemble the old run and gun games like Contra or Metal slug but, the differences is those games you die in one hit, and in Cuphead you have 3 HP (Hit Points)  which you think its pretty balanced and easy with that much.no no no you are wrong there, this game is like pretty hard for a person who is new to the Run and Gun genre, you need skill for this game, Like some Demigod Skill at first, later on you get the hang of it and gets easy till you fight the last two bosses in the game. How to do Online Co-Op People who have a Nvidia GPU you are in luck here so you can do Online co op as long as you have a Nvidia Graphics card/GPU (600 Series)here are the instructions for step by stepLaunch Geforce Experience from the System Tray. Click on Settings icon. From the Settings panel you have to add a tick on "Enable Experimental Functions".Second Enable "Share/In-game overlay". You can see a triangle icon on the top side click on that. Next launch the game and then press Alt + Z. This is the shortcut to launch overlay. Once done you have to go in the Settings of Overlay, the gear icon will be on the right side next to video camera. In that choose Stream (Experimental), and click on yes on the message “Allow friends to join game”.Exit Overlay, you will see a new option "Stream", click on it and choose Guest Controls. Then click on "Play alongside me" and finally click on "Done".Once done click on Stream and then click on "Copy invites URL". Send this link to your friend. Your friend can play with you using a keyboard only.and you got Online co op working for nowbut problem is your friend can only use the keyboard which means he will be player 1 and you will be player 2 if you have a controller. The Soundtrack/Music The soundtrack in this game is a masterpiece (for me but I don't know about you guys).Its Bigband, Jazz, Swing, and Blues all mixed up together into one amazing soundtrack.

Mind Street	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mindstreet/	There are good games.There are great games.There are great difficult games.There are great difficult games that bring so much joy. Maybe it's in the aesthetic, the gameplay, the world building, the characters, the humor, the music or maybe it's a combination of all of those and shows just how much love and care has gone into development? Who knows?But what I can tell you is that, this is a great difficult game that brings you joy, the moment you boot it up!
MrNergles	Recommended	31.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNergles/	TL;DR - Cuphead is a seriously great game, for many reasons, but everything aside the gameplay is what keeps bringing me back.  If you have $20 to burn on a game and you like a solid challenge, addicting gameplay with tight controls you should seriously buy this product. If it ends up too hard or not what you want in games use the Steam Refund; I do ask of you to try and soldier through it because losing is part of the fun. Go try out Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Contra 3, Alien Soldier or another ShmUp/Run&Gun first on an emulator if you aren't sure about the game. Also, use a controller. Couch only co-op, you can play online using a 3rd party app.I am running this game on Windows 10 with a GeForce GTX 870M NVidia card. Playing through this game I used a Mortal Kombat X (X360/X1) fight controller.Review: This game is as welcoming as it comes to anyone looking for a challenge and ready to learn some patterns. Being a huge fan of hand animation and classic Run&Gun games this is my niche. The boss rush and jump/shoot/avoid style approach a type of game that isn't produced often anymore; with that being said the difficulty that this game brings to the table isn't produced often either. This difficulty isn't for the light hearted; you will die, try again and die some more. It resembles the old style of games it is trying to emulate perfectly to the point where it becomes it's own monster. The closest thing this game comes to hand holding is giving you a small hi-five on the tutorial stage. With that being said the game is pretty accessible if you have the focus and the level headedness to learn the patterns in the many tries it takes for you to beat the boss. Patterns are important to this game, without putting the pieces together over a few tries you won't be able to put together the puzzle the level is trying to convey to you. This creates a great personal value for the game and makes you think and learn about the level's design! But if you plan on taking this game on you need to learn the controls.The controls on this game are very tight, they give you so much control that it's easy to lose control of Cuphead/Mugman. I mean that in the best way though, you just forget that they turn on a dime or dash as soon as you tap that button so when you get in a sticky situation it feels unfair but you are the only one to blame. It happens but once you start to understand you can become one with the machine. Moving and dashing aren't the only thing that feels natural to the player, the jumping sensitivity and shooting feel amazing as well as rewarding. All of this being said I do not recomend your keyboard this game was made with a controller in mind, you can bind all keys to whatever you want no matter what you use to play though.Using these tight controls and facing the difficulty/patterns don't really mash up until you add the levels into the mix. The levels are amazing spanning from 19 unique bosses (More if you count King Dice's fight individually) and 6 Run & Gun levels. These bosses are played in a platforming style except 5 of them that are done in a ShmUp style. This creates a nice balance of diversity in a condensed game. Adding to the diversity of each level the game is designed in an amazing Rubber Hose animation style with eye popping color and music true to the era and mood; creating a great experiance for the player. Each level is introduced with it's own episode card which adds a little extra spice to this difficult, fun and aestheticly pleasing burrito. For each burrito there is an end and with that being said would you order that same item again? For Cuphead the answer is yes. The game has an extremely high replay value from Expert Mode, Co-Op, Unlockables/Secrets and it you want to go ham learning those patterns to speedrun! Whether it is wrapping up over world requests from NPC's or destroying a boss with a friend you'll have a lot of fun. The only gripe I have about co-op is that it is couch co-op only, which I understand why but a boy can dream. The final thought's I will leave you on about this game is that this game while being insanely fun, challenging and beautifully put together with the handmade animation/originally composed & preformed music this game won't be for everyone. It's a painfully hard game for anyone to just jump in unless you've spent a lot of time around these type of games or have been playing for a few hours. It really bummed me out I couldn't share this game with my father who loves this animation and music(Someone who han't touched a controller since SNES) other than him watching it for a moment. Its a game that will be discouraging to someone like that. That being said to the people who can take on the challenge or want to learn this game is a clear cut perfect game that you should buy. $20 dollar for this product is criminally low and I am surprised it hasn't been raised to $35-$45 because it is honestly worth that or even more. You get a lot of value for that price. This is one of the best video games I have played for a very long time and has made it's way to my heart extremely fast breaking into my Top 10. 5/5

PresidentBJ	Recommended	15.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BulletTrainsAreWhite/	Cuphead a game about fighting bosses while looking at all the cool rubber hose animation and stylized music, all in order to look like your playing a 1930's cartoon. This game is a gorgeously hand crafted experience worth the purchase for its style alone... gameplay's a bonus and a really good bonus at that.
Trogtor	Recommended	35.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trogtor/	I was up at 5 AM playing this looking for a fourth Barber Shop quartet member hiding in the bushes. After finding him they basically sang me a song about how I should take a break. This game is self aware.
JDEzekude	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mysteryezekude/	Cuphead is a beautifully intense run-and-gun platformer that pays homage to the Golden Age of Animation (e.g. 1930s Disney and Fleischer) and puts your reflexes to the test in a wacky cross between Mega Man and Gunstar Heroes.In this perilous cartoon adventure, you play as Cuphead and/or Mugman on a mission to collect wayward souls after losing a bet with the Devil himself. Thus, you will be pitted against over 20 crazy bosses, each with their own unique design and attack patterns.Throughout this journey, you'll be armed with one or two weapons at a time (which can be shot in 8-directions), a Megaman-X-style dash, a mid-jump parry (for absorbing and/or operating pink objects) and a Super button for pulling off special moves.Each separate boss battle usually lasts 2-5 minutes, but every second counts. In each battle, you must take down the boss without losing all your health points (i.e. 3 minimum, 5 maximum), or else you'll have to start the fight from the beginning. Thankfully, you have infinite lives, so there's no need to worry about dying too many times.Regardless, it can be both frustrating and maddening to lose repeatedly to the same boss, especially when you get so close to beating it. If that weren't enough, each time you lose, the game even shows you how close you are to beating it, accompanied with the boss mocking you. But, on the brighter side, it makes the joy of finally overcoming said boss all the more satisfying. Never before have I experienced this feeling so many times in one game.This game also features 6 tricky platforming stages in which you can collect coins to spend on unlockable weapons (e.g. spread fire, charge shot, etc.) and charms (e.g. 1-2 extra health points, invincible dash, etc.). These stages are a nice change of pace from the onslaught of boss battles. You can also find hidden coins by exploring certain places and carrying out certain tasks on the world map.I personally had high hopes for this game ever since its teaser came out, and the final product has exceeded my expectations with its combination of fluid hand-drawn animation and toughs-as-nails action gameplay. Because of this, it was hard for me to be angry no matter how many times I failed at one boss or another.For me, this game's greatest strength is that it entices its players to keep trying and trying again until they win. And, after you finally triumph over a boss and feel the ecstatic joy of victory, it's then a matter of testing yourself to do better.However, this could've been a perfect game if it had more game modes than just its main story (i.e. lots of boss battles, a few platforming stages), particularly a survival mode or one or more competitive 2-player modes (e.g. race, shooting gallery, etc.). This game features 3 unique stages in which you must parry waves of pink ghosts from an urn in order to unlock a super special move. Unforunately, once you've completed each stage, you can never play them again (unless you start a new game). It would've been nice if this game had an endless mode with those stages in mind, because it would make the perfect break from the usual running and gunning.So, all-in-all, I consider "Cuphead" a colorful rollercoaster of cartoon carnage that will make you laugh, shout, cry and cheer from start to finish (as it made me and many others). Brace yourselves, casual and hardcore gamers alike, you'll be in for a bumpy ride that you'll never forget!

MrNergles	Recommended	31.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNergles/	TL;DR - Cuphead is a seriously great game, for many reasons, but everything aside the gameplay is what keeps bringing me back.  If you have $20 to burn on a game and you like a solid challenge, addicting gameplay with tight controls you should seriously buy this product. If it ends up too hard or not what you want in games use the Steam Refund; I do ask of you to try and soldier through it because losing is part of the fun. Go try out Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Contra 3, Alien Soldier or another ShmUp/Run&Gun first on an emulator if you aren't sure about the game. Also, use a controller. Couch only co-op, you can play online using a 3rd party app.I am running this game on Windows 10 with a GeForce GTX 870M NVidia card. Playing through this game I used a Mortal Kombat X (X360/X1) fight controller.Review: This game is as welcoming as it comes to anyone looking for a challenge and ready to learn some patterns. Being a huge fan of hand animation and classic Run&Gun games this is my niche. The boss rush and jump/shoot/avoid style approach a type of game that isn't produced often anymore; with that being said the difficulty that this game brings to the table isn't produced often either. This difficulty isn't for the light hearted; you will die, try again and die some more. It resembles the old style of games it is trying to emulate perfectly to the point where it becomes it's own monster. The closest thing this game comes to hand holding is giving you a small hi-five on the tutorial stage. With that being said the game is pretty accessible if you have the focus and the level headedness to learn the patterns in the many tries it takes for you to beat the boss. Patterns are important to this game, without putting the pieces together over a few tries you won't be able to put together the puzzle the level is trying to convey to you. This creates a great personal value for the game and makes you think and learn about the level's design! But if you plan on taking this game on you need to learn the controls.The controls on this game are very tight, they give you so much control that it's easy to lose control of Cuphead/Mugman. I mean that in the best way though, you just forget that they turn on a dime or dash as soon as you tap that button so when you get in a sticky situation it feels unfair but you are the only one to blame. It happens but once you start to understand you can become one with the machine. Moving and dashing aren't the only thing that feels natural to the player, the jumping sensitivity and shooting feel amazing as well as rewarding. All of this being said I do not recomend your keyboard this game was made with a controller in mind, you can bind all keys to whatever you want no matter what you use to play though.Using these tight controls and facing the difficulty/patterns don't really mash up until you add the levels into the mix. The levels are amazing spanning from 19 unique bosses (More if you count King Dice's fight individually) and 6 Run & Gun levels. These bosses are played in a platforming style except 5 of them that are done in a ShmUp style. This creates a nice balance of diversity in a condensed game. Adding to the diversity of each level the game is designed in an amazing Rubber Hose animation style with eye popping color and music true to the era and mood; creating a great experiance for the player. Each level is introduced with it's own episode card which adds a little extra spice to this difficult, fun and aestheticly pleasing burrito. For each burrito there is an end and with that being said would you order that same item again? For Cuphead the answer is yes. The game has an extremely high replay value from Expert Mode, Co-Op, Unlockables/Secrets and it you want to go ham learning those patterns to speedrun! Whether it is wrapping up over world requests from NPC's or destroying a boss with a friend you'll have a lot of fun. The only gripe I have about co-op is that it is couch co-op only, which I understand why but a boy can dream. The final thought's I will leave you on about this game is that this game while being insanely fun, challenging and beautifully put together with the handmade animation/originally composed & preformed music this game won't be for everyone. It's a painfully hard game for anyone to just jump in unless you've spent a lot of time around these type of games or have been playing for a few hours. It really bummed me out I couldn't share this game with my father who loves this animation and music(Someone who han't touched a controller since SNES) other than him watching it for a moment. Its a game that will be discouraging to someone like that. That being said to the people who can take on the challenge or want to learn this game is a clear cut perfect game that you should buy. $20 dollar for this product is criminally low and I am surprised it hasn't been raised to $35-$45 because it is honestly worth that or even more. You get a lot of value for that price. This is one of the best video games I have played for a very long time and has made it's way to my heart extremely fast breaking into my Top 10. 5/5

tEMmiE!!!1!!	Recommended	43.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198251878202/	Cuphead, a deja vu sorta game. The game is stylised from the golden age of animation, 1920's. In this review i will break the game down in all it's aspects. Sound:The music of this game is, as you guessed it, from the 1920's and onwards. And nailing it at that! The music is composed inside a studio. The game uses jazzy and classical (less) music. Though the music itself is origanally made. It is amazing in it's music! Now for the special effects such as extra sounds to make it more entertaining and those "Wallop" phrases at the start! You would think that doing the special effects is enough but no, they make it scratchy and make it MORE like the 1920's! Every piece of music, every sound is carefully made and well done! Just amazing. Animation:Since this game is stylised after the 1920's animations, it uses rubber hose animation. If you don't know, you're about to know what it is.-"Rubber hose animation was the first animation style that became standardized in the American animation industry. The defining feature of the style is "rubber hose limbs" — arms, and sometimes legs, that are typically simple, flowing curves, without articulation (no hinged wrists or elbows).[1]" Wikipedia 2017. So basically everything is rubbery and loose. So the limit to what you can draw is, well, there isn't one. And with this style of animation, it flows like water. But anyway, characters that are drawn with rubber hose are never seen standing still. They keep on bobbing and moving. And Cuphead is no exeption. They also overreact ALOT. And yet again, Cuphead nails it! Though the bad thing, is the process of drawing and animating rubber hose AND THEN putting it into a video game. (A decently long one at that) You need to DRAW it on paper, then draw the same thing but a tiny difference in movement that you want it to then repeat the process. Then they had to give it to people to digitally paint it and then put it all together. But it was all worth it for this amazing game! Love it <3.Gameplay:Cuphead is a Run n' Gun and boss game. You need to beat every boss in the world or Inkwell Island in Cuphead's case to progress. You can also purchase ability's that will help you by doing run n' gun stages or finding them in Inkwell islands. The stroyline is the two boys, Cuphead and Mugman, accidently found them selves in the devil's casino on a win streak. Then the devil comes and gives them a deal. "Win the next roll and all the loot in the casino is yours, but if you fail, your souls are mine!" They lose the bet and try to get out of it. The devil says he will let them go if they collect his soul contracts. Then off they go. As the internet says, Cuphead has a reputation of being REALLY HARD. I've played it a fair bit and it took me AGES to beat most bosses. And that's not a bad thing! It challanges your mind in reaction time and all that. It keeps you on your toes. Even if i yell **** and ******* **** i still love this game! It may be hard, but once you beat that boss that you stumbled on countless times before and then you BEAT it. You feel great. A kinda great that will make you jump and yell, YESSSSSSS FINALLY I CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING YEAHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Overall:It is a very good game! The best in the whole era of gaming! With it's animation that is so satisfying, and it's gameplay intense also pared with the sound and music makes you go from having the worst day ever, to seeing a double rainbow, finding a four leaf glover and then winning the lotterly!! It's barley priced to! So you should get it NOW. 10/10.

Starchu ✪	Recommended	24.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101481508/	⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀GIᐯE IᑎTO TᕼE ᗪEᐯIᒪ As a platformer junkie by heart and growing up playing Contra not knowing about the konami code, ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Cuphead is the title I never knew to be my dream game that has come into fruition.⠀The gameplay is a shot to all the senses. (Yes. You can actually smell and taste that victory coming upon a few more retries). It can be easy to dismiss this as another style over substance title, but that would be hell wrong; not with that tight movement and twitch gunplay accompanying all that aesthetic.  At first I thought that the diagonal aiming was a bit iffy, but then found out that it is as intended since it proved to be useful in later sections. The addition of swappable weapons and parrying also sets this ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀game apart from other run n' gun titles (As if the visuals were not enough)I found myself having a wide grin every stage seeing all the whacky and creative bosses, just trying to soak it all in whenever they move into their new form. A feeling of redemption after killing a boss whom ⠀was mocking you for all your countless failures then subsequently follows this. That feeling is bliss.⠀⠀Overall I am very happy to see Cuphead receive mass media attention as I hope it could spark a resurgence of these type of games that purely relies on skill, in contrast to the mainstream "experience ⠀simulators" that hold your hand too often.  Buy this game. Support the developers. You will be elated ⠀⠀when you are a fan of the genre and even if not, this will improve your gaming skills in general.

Hagane	Recommended	40.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051549834/	What to say of this beautiful game that hasn't been said? Cuphead is witty, fun, and porpusely thought platformer delivered through a vintage filter reminding us once again that videogames are artful and entertaining. Don't just borrow this game from your buddy's library, the creators of this gem delivered a compelling experience that stands next to most of your greatest adventures of all time. Even after 105% I'm found still trying to beat every level on expert. It feels reinvented and even though there's no much left to unlock at this point, I keep coming to feel like a god when destroying a boss on a no damage run, almost getting to that final stage with new sequences, but no, he's K.O.'d spat on the floor...

JDEzekude	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mysteryezekude/	Cuphead is a beautifully intense run-and-gun platformer that pays homage to the Golden Age of Animation (e.g. 1930s Disney and Fleischer) and puts your reflexes to the test in a wacky cross between Mega Man and Gunstar Heroes.In this perilous cartoon adventure, you play as Cuphead and/or Mugman on a mission to collect wayward souls after losing a bet with the Devil himself. Thus, you will be pitted against over 20 crazy bosses, each with their own unique design and attack patterns.Throughout this journey, you'll be armed with one or two weapons at a time (which can be shot in 8-directions), a Megaman-X-style dash, a mid-jump parry (for absorbing and/or operating pink objects) and a Super button for pulling off special moves.Each separate boss battle usually lasts 2-5 minutes, but every second counts. In each battle, you must take down the boss without losing all your health points (i.e. 3 minimum, 5 maximum), or else you'll have to start the fight from the beginning. Thankfully, you have infinite lives, so there's no need to worry about dying too many times.Regardless, it can be both frustrating and maddening to lose repeatedly to the same boss, especially when you get so close to beating it. If that weren't enough, each time you lose, the game even shows you how close you are to beating it, accompanied with the boss mocking you. But, on the brighter side, it makes the joy of finally overcoming said boss all the more satisfying. Never before have I experienced this feeling so many times in one game.This game also features 6 tricky platforming stages in which you can collect coins to spend on unlockable weapons (e.g. spread fire, charge shot, etc.) and charms (e.g. 1-2 extra health points, invincible dash, etc.).

¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/	Cuphead is a fantastic 2D platformer with a beautiful, hand-drawn art-style that gives it a lot of charm. The game's story is presented in a way that's reminiscent of old cartoons (think Tom & Jerry, or early Looney Toons), and the art style itself further enhances this; it actually feels as if you were playing one of those cartoons.So, what's the story about? It's about two kids, Cuphead and Mugman, who get in trouble after dealing with the Devil, and now they have to fight the Devil's debtors in order to retrieve their souls. Anyway, it's all an excuse to travel around different levels beating the ever-loving♥♥♥♥♥♥of a bunch of colourful enemies.As far as the gameplay goes, it's fantastic. Like I said in the opening paragraph, it plays like a 2D platformer, although that's kind of a misnomer, since most of the stages actually consist of boss battles, with only a handful of platforming stages. The controls are pretty good, and you have several upgrades that you can acquire through a shop, or special stages. The game is pretty difficult for a newcomer, but not in the sense that it becomes frustrating to play; the fact that most stages are over pretty quickly, and that you get to see how much progress you made through the stage when you die encourages you to keep playing. Honestly, I wasn't even sure I'd be able to finish it when I first started it!The music is top notch. Just like the rest of the game, it's very reminiscent of old cartoons, and you can see they put a lot of work into it, as much as in the rest of the game. Even the audio itself (sound effects, voices, etc.) are well done.Overall, this was one of my favourite games this year, and I really recommend it.

Wacky Wario	Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wackywario/	From what I have seen in this game when I first played it today is that It does remind me of Konami's "Contra" series, and the SEGA Genesis game, "Gunstar Heroes". Despite it being heavily focused on boss battles, there are some things in this game that do give some interesting mechanics like for example: "You can dash like you can do in Capcom's "Mega Man X" games, and you can buy some upgrades with only the coins you find in the game." Apart from that, this is what it would be like if video games were invented in the 1930's (I know they were invented in the 50's but still, you get what I mean) with that old cartoon feel. As much as I grew up watching 1930's to 1980's cartoons as a kid, I gotta say that this really brings me back to my childhood days when classic 1920's 1930's cartoons, etc. used to come on TV. Even though I'm pretty sure that there will probably be a Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 version along with the Xbox One and Steam versions soon, but who knows? It could happen. Once again. This game deserves a thumbs up from me, and a rating of 10/10!
Artichokeslam	Recommended	35.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985690420/	This game finally completes the childhood dream of playing a cartoon.

(YouTube)Dragnix	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/	 Target Audience:   Those who don't want a walk in the park, also art fans Summary:  Despite the target audience above, saying that Cuphead is this revolutionary difficult game is a little misleading. Not in a gaming industry with japanese SHMUPs thats for sure. But Cuphead will kill you over and over again: and that's alright. It's a game that relies on pattern/attack recognition and clawing your way further and further to the end of a boss. The combat mechanics are simple yet effective: as you have a limited set of moves and weapons to work with: but enough to change up  your strategy just enough to deal with specific bosses. Speaking of which, bosses all are unique and aren't altered versions of prior ones. Each battle teaches you something to use in your arsenal, and you have to adapt that lesson to the next ones. Hell, you may even need to throw it away if needed.This is all held together by a presentation that had a LOT of effort put into it....and it shows. The hand drawn characters without digital effects (ok, coloring, but really that's it) must have taken ages to do. But the end result is some of the cleanest animation you've ever seen in a video game, as the ccartoons look as authentic as they possibly could be for emulating the 1930s. The over the top nature of the presentation tells you a lot about all these various bosses without forcing exposition down your throat. And the music and sound design is pretty brilliant, able to emphasize the right parts of gameplay while not emphasizing what you don't need to pay immediate attention to. Where the game falls short for me in that next level of gameplay. The structure of the game is at the core of this problem: once you've mastered a boss, you may get a slight addition to the challenge in expert mode, but not a lot of replayability beyond that. Sure, you'll die a bunch, but it's not like the game requires a lot of skill to get past all of these challenges. Some yes, but not the hand eye coordination of a gaming god. I just, I don't know, I was expecting another layer, something to bring out more of the game when all was said and done. It's not the Game of the Year, not in a year where there's so many top level games coming out. It's just a cut under the top games of 2017, but it's still worth an immediate buy.Video Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv0I52LnZ5s Lists: Positives:  The hand-drawn presentation shows all the effort and love put into it. Characters come to life on the screen.  Animations are top notch. Some of the best animations in video games: indie or AAA.   The Sound design puts the emphasis on gameplay: warning you of the hazards that you don't see first, then going down the line. Controls are exactly what you need for this speed of gameplay: not too loose, not too tight. Just right. Music captures the era of the cartoon perfectly, keeping the action upbeat and jiving throughout the game. Learning mechanisms put on display here and are well implemented.  Simple gameplay works well for the space and battlefield in question.  Bosses hit good strategy variety, forcing you to adapt to them without feeling repetitive. Parry system gives good risk/reward for the most part. Extra weapon options actually give you benefits that are really useful in certain battles, and aren't just straight upgrades. One more run gameplay makes you want to overcome your foes without (for the most part) wanting you to throw your controller against the wall. Negatives: Once you learn a boss's tricks, you pretty much know what to do. The random element doesn't play that big part of the game. They built a really interesting set of characters and world...which leaves you wanting more in terms of the story.  The parry sequence on the dice boss needs some way of allowing you to practice.  Once you beat the game, I lost the feel to want to go back and try them again. The keyboard controls just don't compare to the controller. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that you have to play with a controller. It's just so much better.

Oshwah	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BEANO/	The Positive: Cuphead is a BEAUTIFUL game. The graphics, the sound, the music - are completely accurate to what a 1930's cartoon would be in the day, and I've seen my fair share. The story is classic-feeling and (again) something a 1930's era cartoon would be about, and it's not complex. The price is fair, and there's no BS like in-game DLC, loot boxes, or the other junk that companies like *COUGH* [MOSTLY ALL OF THEM NOW] add to their games in order to repeatedly try and tap your wallet. The controls are basic and not overly-complex (I cover more on this - see "The Mixed" below) and the tutorial is fast and covers them quickly and makes you aware of what you need to know in order to progress through the game - which isn't too many. Overall, I think the developers did a great job and focused on the aspects that many companies sadly overlook - the gameplay. The level navigation, progression, and design is diverse and well thought-out. The only bug I found was a graphic that didn't disappear when it should have - the "crying tears" of the 'onion boss' didn't disappear after I had defeated it, and it remained during the rest of the level. However, I was only able to produce it once time and it didn't affect the gameplay.The Mixed: While the game is themed around a 1930's cartoon, don't let the cartoon-style looks fool you - this game is BLOODY DIFFICULT! You can lower the difficulty down a notch but only on the battle-styled levels, not on the "gun and run" stages. The controls aren't complex and neither are the number of moves you're required to learn in order to play, but you better memorize them and you better become a master at which key does which, or you're not progressing at all. You press the X key instead of the Shift key and make a mistake, you're not finishing the level and you're better off just selecting "RETRY" in the pause menu and starting over. I don't count this as a negative, as I love challenges and I can't knock a game down because of that. This difficulty can be disheartening for some and motivating for others. However, I feel that when I play, there's a big frustration factor that the difficulty absolutely plays into. I'll play for one hour and exit the game having not progressed a single level. However, it's not frustrating to the level that I stop playing - I find myself coming back after taking a break and having at it some more. I will say this, however: I feel that I am progressing through the game partially by mastering the controls, but also because I'm memorizing exactly how the level plays and when I should move, jump, shoot, or dash. Again, I'm mixed on the difficulty. I feel that if I could knock the difficulty down a notch on all stages and take a lower score, the game would appeal to those who just want to play and without yelling a curse word after dying for the 10th time on the same level.The Negative: Pretty much nothing. The only thing I call BS on is how I'll attempt to hit a pink object and it'll occasionally both count as a "success" (as in I successfully hit the object) and also count as a "hit" (meaning that the object hit me and knocks off 1 HP). It's miniscule and really not worth mentioning as a negative, but sorry - if you're going to make a game this difficult, you should expect people to call you out on things like that. Other than this, that's pretty much it.
Gunnar	Recommended	7.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gunnarking/	I've gotten about 2 hours into this game as I'm reviewing this. I've beaten the Tutorial and approximately two stages. It's one of the most difficult and rewarding games I've ever played in my life. The Art and OST are seamless, timeless, and I'm sure would fit in the 50's-70's cartoons it's based on. I don't purchase many full price games. This is one I glad I did.

IamDinosaur	Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aurealis-san/	Developer: Studio MDHRGenre: Run and Gun, Platform and Boss RushRelease Date: September 29 2017"It's time for a world class bout, now GO!" - The Devil speaks itself after the countdownSummary:Cuphead is a run and gun game, created by small indie company Studio MDHR. The game was originally announced back in E3 2014 but it was delayed because they needed more time to polish the game. It is safe to say that this game delivered way beyond expectation, like seriously, give these guys a round of applause for their greatest work and deserve a recognition. I will address some negative reviews later because it is irritating me. So let's talk about Cuphead in depth.Story:It is a tale of Cuphead and Mughead. Two boys are having fun and wondering around the map until they discover The Devil's Casino. Cuphead and Mughead decide to gamble and they are on a winning streak. Until the Devil himself appeared, he makes a proposition; if the Cuphead and Mughead wins the gamble, they are going to take the casino and everything, if they lose; their souls will be consumed by the Devil. Cuphead decides to be greedy and they lose the bet, meaning that their souls will be taken but they want to live instead. So they make another proposition from them. The Devil wants the Soul Contracts and they are in deep trouble once they got kicked out. Luckily, the Elder Kettle will help you out and do what the Devil says.Gameplay:The gameplay of Cuphead is very simple yet effective. It really reminds me of run and gun games like Contra series or should I say Contra-esque gameplay. The game provides an open world exploration but it is linear, that doesn't mean it's not a bad thing since it's supposed to capture the aesthetics of the game or more like what if there's a video game in 1930s. They added an upgrade system and you spend coins to buy shot types (spreads, charged shots, etc.) and charms (extra lives, supers regeneration, etc.) There is a parry system and it is intuitive to use. It is not a traditional parry like Dark Souls (lmfao), it is a visual cue (any pink projectiles or enemies). The controls are tight and customisable which is a great additional in case of everyone wants to have their own controls. It's easy to pick up the controller and master the mechanics. Every boss fights are unique and I love each bosses (even though it made me cry internally when I almost kill every bosses in the game). Cuphead implemented Co-Op during the playthrough, but unfortunately the game does not support online and I am not against it.Technical Aspect:The setting sets in 1930s like I mention on Gameplay paragraph. They absolutely capture the jazz musical scores, the animation of every single characters (I can't believe it's a frame by frame animation), the lively background during boss fights. The musical score and graphics, they are a 10 out of 10 rating. I was actually humming some boss fight's theme and they are catchy as. I love the references they add, like Acme from Looney Tunes or other things that is related to 1930s cartoon shows.Address to the Negative Reviews:I am going to address the negative reviews, so bear with me. Cuphead is challenging and fair, not impossible and difficult. This is what the game is meant to be played. The game throws back to the 90s platform run and gun shooter and boss rushes game. It helps you to be a perfectionist or getting better at it. I know people are sick of getting killed over and over again, but let me say this, it helps you to analyze what you did wrong on certain sections and improve it. Seriously, negative reviews are making me cringe because people say how lazy the difficulty is and the gameplay isn't too deep or repetitive. I know there is one saying; looks can be deceiving and this is the game that works out too well. I think that should wrap up this address.Verdict:Cuphead is one of the best indie platform run and gun game I have ever played for a while. The story seems basic but it didn't hold me back anyway. The gameplay is Contra-esque, which is fun for me. The musical scores, graphics and settings are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I hate to say this, Cuphead is not for everybody because of the difficulty but still give this game a try, it's a great game to start playing the difficult game genre. The bugs in this game are somewhat minimal, so I do not think there are any game breaking bugs I encountered so far. The official score for this game, a 9 out of 10.
AfroNinja360	Recommended	36.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/afroninja360/	Even through its presentation alone, Cuphead is a gem of a game. It plays with the creativity and freedom that animation can unleash, especially the madness that lies within vintage animation of the early 1900's. It's just full of so much to see and even as a lifelong cartoon lover, it kept me engaged to see what crazy characters would come next. And I'm only about halfway through! Cuphead doesn't just copy traits of retro 30's animation, it fully captures all those elements and styles and applies the same techniques used back in the day to create one of the most unique looking games I've ever seen. Where Skullgirls also amazed me with its hand-drawn animated characters and art, Cuphead is the 2D platformer variation that kicks it into high gear. Even the soundtrack is superb with its big band jazz score and other variations of classic swing. The mood and feel is captured greatly.On the gameplay side, I'm happy to say it fits just as much as its evolutionary style does! If you enjoy such run and gun games like Mega Man, Contra or Metal Slug, this'll be right up your alley. Through a game that's mostly big bosses and does include platforming levels, it's a bit of bullet hell and it can be quite the challange when you jump straight in. In Cuphead, practice makes perfect and that's where the addictive nature of it comes into play, where you've studied the boss and their attack patterns so much, you'll go back for another shot hoping to finally beat them. All the different upgrades and diverse locations and characters make for an extremely enjoyable game that I can't wait to beat.So if you've thought about picking Cuphead up for a round of classic platformin' cartoony boss rush action, I'd totally recommend you pick it up. Studio MDHR and their wonderful crew have provided something absolutely quality and the work that has gone in to create a whole game that looks like an animated cartoon has paid off phenomenally. A stellar time that combines so many of my favorite things. The years of wait have been worth it!

Kamblan	Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198187030634/	after playing this game,I found a new way for someone to commit suicide, heres how you do it. Step 1 is to take a bottle of bleach and pour all of it down your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Step 2 is to wait 10-15 minutes for bleach to start making clorox babies around your heart. Step 3 is then invite them to come into your heart where they will NOT kill you but♥♥♥♥♥♥your heart. and lastly is tell all the clorox babies replace your organs with clorox bottles, your blood with clorox bleach, let them turn you into the bleach. Also you can't stop this after you do step 1 so once you do this there is no going back. You must accept the bleach. Feel the bleach. eat the bleach. breath the bleach. BECOME the bleach. Or just jump off a ♥♥♥♥ing building or something.

Love it!
Adronat	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adronat/	I had my doubts whether Cuphead would've been the kind of game that revolved largely around its style, but it quickly became clear that the devs really know what makes for an engaging and high-quality boss fight.So much thought was put into the bosses, consistently! The patterns are almost all of the time reasonable due to careful timing and clear audiovisual telegraphing, but damn...the amount of creativity crammed into these fights is second to none:1) Aesthetically beautiful battles, but also how the team ran with an theme and made a given boss attacks (or the way the fight unfolds) feel cohesive.2) Finding the time to cram in all kinds of gags or referential nods throughout the whole thing without it interrupting the flow of the fight or without relying on the same gimmicks.3) Fights feel fresh from beginning to end.Cuphead is a legitimately impressive game. Adding the run & gun stages and the sublime 30's jazz soundtrack is just the icing on the cake.Couldn't recommend it enough: "MUST HAVE" game.

It's in this sorta place where the boss mechanics and attack patterns that take up most of the game aren't really that difficult compared to harder platformers that came before it, and what is difficult is the single life three hitpoint limit imposed on every level. The difficulty comes down to learning and perfectly executing not-all-that-hard segments of a bossfight that turn into a test of endurance when they're strung together. Bossfights also begin to randomize some elements, making you perfect even more segments until you either get all of them down perfect or (more likely) just have the randomized elements happen in the right order to make the easiest run. I got up to the third island - that I've heard is the last hub in the game before the final boss - in roughly 2 hours and haven't really felt any urge to play it since. Nothing about fighting the bee lady over and over for example has me so enthralled that I can't wait to get back to it, I'm not on the edge of my seat every time I drop from a randomized scrolling platform to dodge a fast but predictable projectile. Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are entertaining since they're well executed in the context of the genre they're in, but losing to the bosses over and over doesn't get me worked up and motivated like it does in other hard games like Devil May Cry/Bayonetta, Contra/Hard Corps or DoDonPachi because the game doesn't do much to make the fights anything but mechanically sterile and repetitive. Instead, repeating content over and over to get a mistake-free run just makes me feel tired. Beating bosses is less of a "YEAH, I DID IT!" and more of a "♥♥♥♥, finally. What's next?" and I'd say that's owed mostly to the fact that doing a winning run feels pretty much exactly the same as the doing any of the runs that preceded them, just I didn't get hit by the thing by accident this time around. I'm not really pulling the lead out and totally perfectly executing moves like crazy and getting the adrenaline pumping, GOD DAMN! - I'm just performing some simple mechanics and not making a mistake this time around.I'll still put the time into beating it, because the basic mechanics are fun and solid and the presentation and art more than make up for the gameplay being just average. I just don't think it's the incredible, tens-across-the-board best platformer ever it's being made out to be. I'd much rather play the same game as a linear, lives based, contra-like affair, even if the end result was the game being significantly easier, anything that stops the gameplay loop from being fight boss -> ♥♥♥♥ up -> repeat until the fight's mechanics become boring -> don't ♥♥♥♥ up one time. I thought I'd love this game because I do really love ballbusting difficulty, but I feel it isn't handled in a way that adds any value to the game for me.★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ 3/5

Ding Dong	Recommended	54.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xboy351/	I played through the game 3 times now,and it's pretty good.
「ṨҜץץ」	Recommended	91.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skyysostupid/	Cuphead is one of my favorite games of 2017, and maybe even of all time. Theis game consists of 6 Run n' Gun stages, 3 Mausoleum  stages, and 19 Boss figthts and is definitely worth the price. While I still have to complete the game (I still have a few soul contracts and Inkwell Hell to defeat before I complete the game), it's been a joyride from the times I've played and even nearing the conclusion I'm having fun. The game is really challenging, even to some extent too challenging sometimes, and will take a lot of time up. The art style is gorgeous and the music is one of the best this year!! So if you have a lot of free time and are good at multi tasking (You're gonna need it for some of these battles) I do highly suggest it. Cuphead is truely and amazing game.

hanscoeg	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198331876293/	oh so funny to see people people complaining this game because this game is so hard. dude seriousloy?
coke13	Recommended	13.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AntiCrust/	Cuphead is very interesting. Its a challenge, but not as hard as some people make it out to be. The game is a  lesson in patterns, if you are good at learning how the bosses attack the game is easy, if you are bad at learning things this game will be very very very hard. The bosses are really fun, the run and gun levels are very fun. There is no true negative to the game in my opinion. The art is good and the game play matches it. The only annoyance is the one RNG boss in the game (the dragon on world 2). Other then that boss the game is a 10/10 but because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG of that boss it gets a 9/10. 
rippcharddrive :	Recommended	47.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rippcharddrive/	breathtaking game with an inspiring art style; now i just wanna go back to disney world and pretend im shooting people with my finger.

plp	Recommended	61.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/notplp/	I have never felt OBLIGATED to write a review until today.After 7 hours in (finished my first World 2 boss), I can say this game is easily one of my favorites.The early 1900's cartoon aesthetic works so well. Everything is beautifully animated, extremely charming, and fun to look at. The matching 1900's style music obviously fits very well with the game's art, it's also really catchy and fun to listen to over and over.The game has really tight controls. Shooting and dashing are very satisfying to do, especially when you pull off some cool dodge maneuver during bosses.The gameplay is mixed up by these auto-scrollish airplane bosses. I usually hate these types oflevels/fights in games but the way the bosses are designed it adds a good mix of gameplay variety and I'm actually looking forward to more of them.Albeit I've only played about 3 of them, the platforming levels in this game so far are fantastic. A great mix of shooting enemies and precision platforming make for some very satisfying gameplay.Bosses are very nicely varied in terms of design and gameplay. Even though you kill them all the same, they all feel unique to play because of how their attacks force you to play completely different each time.The difficulty of the game is extremely well balanced. I would get to a new boss, get my♥♥♥♥♥BEAT, then in about 10 minutes learn the patterns and pull off the fight. Every death I've had never felt like it was the games fault but my own. Going for an A+ (and eventually S) on levels adds a ton of replay value (hence most of my time being spent in World 1).I cannot stress enough how amazing this game has been. If you like platformers or shoot-em-ups, PLEASE buy this game. Everything about it is so well done and it's extremely fun and addicting.TLDR: Cuphead is great, buy it.

Blade Master 42	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062479889/	This game is going to frustrate the hell out of you, but only because your fragile meat hands won't do what your brain tells you to. Let's get one thing out of the way: Cuphead is hard, but it is very, very fair. This is not to say you won't ever get blindsided when a new boss pattern emerges as you make your way through a fight. However, even if that does use up your last hit point, you're back in the fight in five seconds. These are the best defenses about the difficulty of cuphead. That the iteration time on your failure is very short, and the controls are tight and responsive. On top of that, the stages are, provided you can clear them, very short. My average clear times go from just over two minutes to under three. This, naturally, doesn't account for all the time I spent eating♥♥♥♥♥♥on a given stage, but I'd rather not know that to be honest. Assuming you were able to make a perfect run on every stage, you'd probably be able to clear the game in just under an hour. I've put in six and a half at time of writing, and I'm just into the third section of the game.I could talk about the great handdrawn visuals, but you've probably seen those already, along with the music. Unless you have blood pressure problems, or take issue with difficult games, get Cuphead. It's rad.
nick	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/9071770/	Cuphead is a hand-drawn side scroller shooter which plays just like the classics. You need to learn the levels and patterns before you can beat them and eventually you can master fights that you once thought difficult. The game also has an incredible soundtrack which I recommend you purchase because it comes with well over 50 tracks. I only wish the game had online co-op from launch and also wish you could bind things to your mouse. I played through the entire game on keyboard so if you don't own a controller no need to worry because you can complete it the classic way.I recommend you pick this title up, it's not something you want to miss out on.
quack.quack.bloobloo	Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164387651/	Its a platformer where you need to listen to audio and visual cues for incoming attacks. Dying for first few rounds is a part of  the game because you need to learn these cues for every boss. When you die it shows you far you were from finishing the boss. Whether or not this game will be difficult for you depends on how good you are at reading the cues and remembering sequences of attacks. Tip for begginers for buying a starting attack:  at your first shop there is a close range red attack on sale which shoots in multiple directions and basically acts like a shotgun. This will help lower the boss's health much faster and also easily counter homing projectiles.

Cthulhu's Gribbly Monocle	Recommended	11.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shinwa/	Score: 8.5 / 10Price/Value: -$20Time: 11 Hours (Including A+ time)Difficulty: Completed Regular, working through ExpertActual Difficulty: Minor / ModerateInput Used: Keyboard & ControllerCuphead is a wonderful delight in it's animation and nostaIgic melodies; a somewhat challenging colourful action platformer in the guise of a 1930's children's cartoon. As mentioned above, Cuphead is an action platformer focused around two types of stages: Run n' Gun & multi-form boss fights. Many gamers of experience will immediately compare Cuphead's gameplay to that of Contra, Metal Slug & Mega Man; as the controls are incredibly tight - both on controller AND keyboard. I will comment that the game does become something of a cakewalk when a controller is used, making keyboard controls another layer of challenge. Recommend the standard W,A,S,D configuration. Difficulty, let's address it and the hype. Is this game as brutal and punishing as many claim it to be? No, not in the slightest. I have certainly played far more challenging titles of a similar nature in my life and the keys to success in Cuphead are the following: PATIENCE & PATTERN RECOGNITION. This game is beatable and can be a delight in the process; I'm looking forward to completing Expert - which seems incredibly simlar to Regular, just with a slight speed increase and weapon power decrease.Upgrades come in the form of: Super Abilities, Shot Types and Off-hand Charms. Super Abilities are just that, SUPER abilites! These are ready for use when your super meter at the bottom left of the screen is full charged. Being three in total - a horizontal attack, temporary invincibility and a form of mega cuphead tornado - I found myself sticking to the first.Shot Types are classics from NES/SNES games of old: Spread, lobber, hookshot, homing, etc. You purchase these from the shop and equip them as you please - two at a time - before entering a stage. A little trial and error will help you figure out the best combination for each stage.Off-hand Charms are many, but I used only one 'Smoke Bomb'. This allows you to dodge with an invincibility effect through enemies; incredibly handy.A delight from start to finish; decades old gamers will find a gem here that will remind them of games from their own childhood in the skin of our cartoons. Highly recommended.

Dr. Spagooter	Recommended	12.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr_Spagooter/	The whole art style in this game, and the fact that it's hard as hell convinced me enough to steal a few welfare checks and use it to spend it on this.  I feel like I put those checks into charity of something that's important in life (like my bills which I should really be paying for).  I really enjoy the art style, and I really find it stunning the devs actually handrawn the animation like people in the 1930s would back then(since the fact that's what the game was suppose to feel like). I also like the fact it's hard, but not "hard", to the point where you either barely or don't make any progress(even though I'm currently at world two despite writing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review).  It's just a learning curve with each boss on how beat them, and be able to figure out what the hell you're suppose to do to not get demolished in your no-death/no damage run.  Thought the tutorial.................was not that hard at all dean you god damn "journalist" I never managed to get very angry in this game knowing it's hard.  Though,  If you tend to break a few monitors, a controller, a headset, a few keyboards, and/or break a mouse (that's already screwed) over a tough game like this, then please prevent abuse for electronics and don't buy this game.Otherwise, please help out these poor devs pay rent, and spend those sweet welfare checks to these guys.please :(

𝕟𝕦𝕔𝕝𝕖𝕒𝕣 𝕕𝕙𝕒𝕣𝕞𝕚𝕤𝕥	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041596430/	Absolutely fantastic game all round- the art style / development techniques, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the narrative, all of it! However, there is one boss, which is fundamentaly flawed due to a number of factors, that I think should be redesigned. This is the Honeycomb Herald.To start, the fight is a vertical autoscroller; this in itself is already a poor design choice as the standard monitor's aspect ratio obviously favours the horizontal- allowing for time to see incoming projectiles and react accordingly as the screen forces you along. When it's vertical, however, there is little to no time to react, especially when sprites fly at you from out of view thanks to this orientation and can often just hit you after being on the screen for less than half a second.Secondly, dealing with platforms in a fluid and responsive manner (moving between both up and down) has always been a problem in platformers. When this is made even more difficult by the RNG of platform placement while the game is forcing you upwards, and there isn't sufficient vertical screen space to see if there will be platforms or not, it just makes for an annoying experience that is nigh-on impossible for the player to navigate around tactically without just a good pattern from luck.The RNG of the projectiles / enemies in combination with all this just makes for a complete mess.Overall, all of these aspects made this boss fight straight up un-fun. Unlike other bosses where they were frustrating, but the fault was entirely down to player error and the fights themselves were still enjoyable, as well as rewarding when beaten. Again, fantastic game all round, but that one boss was an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise incredible experience.

Don't expect beating ANYTHING on your first try.Don't let this fact change your mind though, Cuphead has you learn the bosses moves. The boss moves always follow a pattern and learning these patterns stops you from spending the rest of your life on a boss.Overall, it's a REALLY good game. And seeing the visuals makes me want to cry tears of joy. I really recommend that you buy this.If you bring a friend along, you can infinitely revive them.

1412Destroyer	Recommended	30.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/1412Destroyer/	With the awards ceremony coming again this year, I decided to finally review this game. This game has an amazing soundtrack, and some bosses you can never forget. That being said, watching people play it you think, "Why do these people suck so much. I'm sure my GRANDMA could do better than that." Maybe this is why people got the game, to show that they could do better than most of the people online. They quickly realised, "I see why they died so much." This game makes you retry over and over, hoping to proceed to the next run and gun or boss. It is quite enjoyable. This is why I will use my, "Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude! 2.0", reward for this game. My reason for this might be the little note, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", but who knows?

Kareemo	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198211899527/	Not an easy game but not that hard, pretty much how video games should be made!
Colind8	Recommended	28.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Colind8/	Well Cuphead and his pal Mugman, They like to roll the dice, by chance they came on devil's game and gosh they paid the price...PAID THE P R I C E ! ! ! !If your looking for a good game that takes 1930 cartoon visuals and combines them with the Shoot Em' Up games from 1980, than this might be the game for you!However, keep in mind this is on Super Meat Boy level of difficulty. Don't expect beating ANYTHING on your first try.Don't let this fact change your mind though, Cuphead has you learn the bosses moves. The boss moves always follow a pattern and learning these patterns stops you from spending the rest of your life on a boss.Overall, it's a REALLY good game. And seeing the visuals makes me want to cry tears of joy. I really recommend that you buy this.If you bring a friend along, you can infinitely revive them. Just parry their ghost before it reaches the top of the screen! 
LSD	Recommended	49.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356495165/	I thought this game looked cool and saw it was on sale so I bought it. Little did I know this game would consume me. This game will have you thinking that there is nothing you can do to gain the upperhand. Which makes it sweeter when you do beat them. Challenging but fair. If you are looking for a game that looks great, sounds great, feels great, and makes you feel helpless yet powerful Cuphead is for you. It is one of the best games I have been fortunite enough to play and is a game I am proud to say I beat.
Spyder	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963882586/	The quality in presentation is worth it alone, good thing there's a real game underneath for me to recommend it anyway. You won't be seeing graphics like this soon again even with Cuphead's recent success, so enjoy it.
PsychoCat 猫	Recommended	23.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/psychocatx/	This game will make you hate every single boss in it...  every single boss But it's fun with friends!
Dragnrx	Recommended	44.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dragnrx/	Cuphead, 'Don't Deal With The Devil', at this rate if I can, I would like to..*smashcheapcontrollertotheground!* It's almost impossible to win, but it's possible, git gud and the reward feels gud.
Echo the Buster	Recommended	20.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067583889/	Just cup me up daddy. 10/10
NinjaHawk	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjahawk44/	From the phenomenal art, to the exciting, yet challenging boss fights. Cuphead is an amazing game and completely worth getting.Lived up to all hype and exceeded it.
Matterhorn	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MWoomer/	If your here not just for gameplay, but also the incredible 30`s cartoon animation and the great soundtrack you have come to the right place
garnc	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/garnc/	Cuphead is like an extremely hot girlfriend who is way out of your league, however, they are also very emotionally abusive.
Harbie	Recommended	6.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsHarbie/	I love this game so much, it is VERY hard. (lmao) The art style is A1, the story is great, the mechanics and gameplay are fluent. Every aspect of the game is 5 stars, a personal 10/10 from me. If you have $20 laying around, buy this game.
Cheese	Recommended	49.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CheeseOnSteam/	you owe me a new controller.
Jackjen	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198448724277/	Game is great, it is just HARD! Difficult, but it has a lot of adventure. And I really like it! Hopefully, there can be another cuphead game.
数分林老师	Recommended	4.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073863399/	This game is super interesting. I really love it. It's old-school, it's hardcore. It's like the DARKSOULS in some ways, but it's more funny. You die, but you won't get angry. This game has it's unique charm, and this charm is irresistble.
pixel	Recommended	46.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixel47948/	This game is a good game with good animations and best  design and your gonna say ♥♥♥♥  100,000,000 times when you die

sauce boss	Recommended	59.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198304856739/	It is a really good game. The visuals are stunning, the sound track, my god the S O U N D T R A C K. One big problem with this games is sometimes you get really bad rng is this game and you feel like you want to die. Overall, this game is a 4/5
scoi007	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/scoi007/	Ugh, Cuphead is so well put-together, it makes me jealous. The hand-drawn art, the wonderful animation cycles that provide both luscious visuals and great gameplay hints, the original soundtrack that somehow feels nostalgic the first time you hear it – it all works and works wonderfully.Is it any wonder that my kids love watching me play Cuphead? There are times when I’m playing when I kind of wish I could set my controller down and just watch what’s happening.Which I can’t, of course. Because I’d die. I die a lot in Cuphead and it’s OK I suppose. The gameplay is solid, but nothing I haven’t experienced before. The platforming frustrates me the most, but I’m really here for the wonderful package that challenging gameplay is delivered in.Which is enough? Maybe? There are moments when I hate it, but maybe I just hate it for being so beautiful and I’m just a spiteful little man.
Gentleman Cat	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114211893/	Well.there is only one thing i want to share.u will die a lot

A Mirage Euphoria	Recommended	26.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059374153/	Did you know that Steam censors profanity with little hearts? I think that's cute. So to express how much I love and recommend this game's fun challenge, great soundtrack and unique style I will just write a lot of "hearts" in this review.In a nutshell: Like Steam, Cuphead turns frustration and profanity into love!
JENNY COOL	Recommended	21.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/twitchymax/	Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because it happend.

yung corn	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198221268868/	Great game and I love the art style, but the onion boss is obviously impossible and no one has ever got passed him
Soft Luxerino	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Charly-sparks/	Contra in the 30's looks great
Dazmann	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/daznchazlol/	fun but hard
RedReapee	Recommended	37.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130972899/	everything in this game is amazingthe art stylethe gameplaythe difficulty everything cuphead was an amazing game
depression	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/graviticring/	this game has a beautiful aesthetic and if youre up for a challange it's great for u but it makes me wanna killmyself at the same time yet i enjoy the pain
(G.S.W.P) McBarries	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198273915922/	i love that finaly a game gives me a challange . Also the music and the visuals are amaizing... i have no other words :P 
EggSucker888	Recommended	102.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198318407836/	Incredible game. The soundtrack and visual style are amazing, and the gameplay is extremely fun and difficult. The only downside is that there is no online multiplayer.
D&D Joe	Recommended	25.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198406538271/	For all of you who are on the ropes with buying this game whether thinking either it will be to hard or not as rewarding I can proudly say those are do not exist in this game.  Yes it is hard but overtime you will learn new strategies and weapon usage and eventually beat the bosses and soon the game itself.  As for the rewarding gameplay they're are new modes, weapons, and other achievements for you to come back to.  Overall if you want a challenging, unique, beautiful game look new further.
rakenessa	Recommended	27.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakenessa/	Art/visuals, the individuality of each character, music, overall world mapping, difficulty, aesthetic and atmosphere is incredible - a lot of hard work went into this game and it shows. I keep going back to play it.
Ole Case	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067890752/	After perishing 160 times and hitting "Retry" at least that many, I completed the charming story of two brothers who made a deal with the devil in a little over 10 hours. Don't let the difficulty dissuade you from playing this game. I can safely say this is one of the best indie games I've ever played. It's mechanics are flawless and when you die, it truly is your fault. No death is cheap, and each one make you better at the game. It also has some of the best animation and music I've ever seen in any media type, let alone a video game. There are only a couple flaws to the game in my opinion: 1) It currently doesn't have online co-op on release, but the devs are looking into adding this feature. 2) Adding more "Run N' Gun" sections would give the game more of a "play level then beat boss" formula, but this isn't too big of a negative since it is a "Boss Rush" game and is just something I personally would prefer.Bosses that will give you a true sense of pride and accomplishment:-Grim Matchstick (the green dragon)-Rumor Honeybottoms (the queen bee)-Dr. Khal's Robot-King Dice-The Devil   Overall, Cuphead is an excellent debut effort by Chad and Jared Moldenhauer and everyone at Studio MDHR, and I can't wait to see their next project.Review Rating: 9/10
Dogglas Falcon	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198169340304/	In this 30's playable cartoon, you play as a sentient cup of milk (and his mug friend) that gambled with skeletons, a dice and the Devil. You have to collect the souls of every other cartoon debtor to keep your own. While the cup uses his babby pea-shooter to do battle, his enemies will use a variety of attacks that will make the player cry uncle, aunt, mom, dad, sister and brother. You can also upgrade your pea-shooter by trading coins with a fat vendor pig.All in all, a good demonstration of how calcium is good for your health.
Ahams	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ahams/	An absoloute blast, gut wrenching, palm sweating, mind bogging, fury inducing of a game. This game has a really special place in my heart. Not only does this game deliver, but it delivers with its own 1930's style too. The soundtrack is incredibly good. Can only recommend this game to any and everyone out there!
Nigel Thornberry	Recommended	32.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107160943/	What can i say about this game that has not been said before,The visuals are ASTONISHING and hands down make the game worth the price just from the visualsThe gameplay is great and although hard and difficult, very rewarding for when you complete the level.I reccomend this game completly and is worth even more then the 20 doller price10/10 game!
Boo! A Madea Halloween	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorZyla/	SUCK MY♥♥♥♥♥♥KING DICE YOU DEAD ♥♥♥♥♥ HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[アイコン] judan ♥	Recommended	33.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/judanwugnar/	Overall, this game is a rollercoaster of emotions all at once, giving the player the most satisfying feeling when beating bosses and levels. I heavily reccomend if you enjoy hard games or 2D.

Jezze	Recommended	3.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/imjezze/	If you like Shoot 'em Ups and Run & Guns this game is definitely for you. The beautiful animated old-school cartoon look is so hilarious and the sound and music totally fits this art style. Even if you're not usually listen to Jazz and Barbershop, you will like it!
Unicorn with an Axe	Recommended	39.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198423350461/	By GOlly this game is amazing!
GoofNuts	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198280770277/	I absolutely love this game.. it is very very hard but it’s not a game that’s so hard that you want to give up, it’s also fun, and it makes you want to keep trying again and again to beat that terribly difficult boss but then you get the patterns and you kill him and get that “KNOCKOUT” and it feels sooo good!  Possibly favorite game of 2017.
UberOctopus	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192674958/	Great game, with a great soundtrack, great bosses.
PhrostedPhlakes	Recommended	15.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198138099744/	Cuphead is absolutely one of the best games i've played this year. Every aspect of this game is incredibly charming and its easy to tell the creators put all their passion into the project. Cudos to the folks over at MDHR.
Zeon	Recommended	50.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/weird-kid/	Cuphead has to be the best hardest game with the 60's (I assume) theme, which makes it unique. It has amazing bosses related to the theme, and a unique game mode, the Run & Gun. I do reccomend this, but not for the faint of heart, or rage. 8/10 (-2 based on my skill. Sorry!)
YagamiBrando	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/	Run and Gun at its best. Cuphead is a must if you like games like Contra, Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier.Lots of bosses, stunning visual style paying tribute to 30's cartoons, nice soundtrack and couch coop. What else to be desired?The game is challenging but fair, with a bit of practice you will best it. In the end it comes to pattern memorising and reaction, just like in old good contra games.10 out of 10 so far.
The Incredible Furnace	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/waytofurnace/	Beat all Inkwell Island's lords and the devil himself wthin 24 hours to save your soul. Already wrecks yeah?This is live-die-repeat process until contract is fulfilled covered with wonderful jazz and true 30-40's cartoons animation.10 cupheads / 10 mugmans.Would make some matches red hot again.
☢️Captain Megaton	Recommended	7.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ozzalin/	Well...

Cebola Pilocudo	Recommended	30.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050340469/	Nice music and gameplay
Jayrab	Recommended	13.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shurkan/	Cuphead is a brilliant game.I'm not going to go into much detail about the art style and music because there's not much that I could say that hasn't already been said by others. I enjoyed both of these aspects of the game, but what sells it on top of everything is the gameplay.Cuphead is a challenging game, but what fascinates me the most is that eventhough it stays consistantly challenging, the game never felt frustrating or aggravating! I never felt like "rage-quitting" the game, because eventhough there were bosses that I had to retry 20-30 times before I could properly nail them down, I still had fun. With every time I retried a boss, I felt like I was learning something new, figuring out new ways on how I could beat a certain stage even faster than before. This constant feeling of re-evaluation and improvement is what kept me afloat. And at the end it truly felt like I deserved to beat the game.A lot of games now a days are too eager to just hand you your victory. This one makes you work for it and it pays off in the end. I just felt satisfied playing through the game.I've played through it on Regular difficulty in ~9-10 hours. After that, there's still more challenges for you, like beating the game on Expert or playing through each stage without killing an enemy. For such a cheap game, there's a lot of content to be had.I can't recommend this game enough, especially for people that like this sort of bullet hell/run and gun gameplay.
DRIP OR DROWN	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198305010968/	for anyone thinking about buying it this christmas whether its for yourself or a friend, do it. This game is amazing and has one of the best art stlyes and soundtracks in gaming history, not to mention the intense gameplay.
OneCrazyEgyptian	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OneCrazyEgyptian/	Cuphead is AMAZING! yes its really difficult but its also addicting. get it NOW!
mikemaggioo	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/simplesimpl/	I'm only an hour in and I've broken my keyboard. 10/10 im going to take a devil filled♥♥♥♥♥
enzo	Recommended	31.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044768556/	I enjoy Cuphead more than probably any other game.Even after an hour of trying to get that S, every try stays pure joy.
CruddySky	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137848593/	The 1930's visuals are great, makes me feel like I was born 87 years ago. Would totally recommend.

UberOctopus	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192674958/	Great game, with a great soundtrack, great bosses.
GunBrick	Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198166444541/	This Game is just so perfect and so unique I just forget everything when I play it. It has so much dedication and creativity in it, seriously how could you not like this game?
GERWIN	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198448130445/	Grea game, took me about 3-4 days to complete, a ful 8 hours!
RightSezPez	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheemosaurus/	I remember seeing a preview of this game and I knew, without knowing anything about it, I was going to buy it based on it's visuals alone. I'm glad I did. I paid full price on the day it released and it was worth it.The art style is beautiful, the music glorious and the gameplay is actually pretty solid, difficult but fair.You'll rage out but not because the game done you over but because YOU screwed up. If you're like me, you'll no doubt do this quite often! This is good though, it's a learning curve. You'll learn from your mistakes, you'll learn the enemies patterns and eventually you'll learn how to overcome them.Word of warning - If you don't like difficult games then I would avoid this. It was made to be challenging. If I remember correctly there is an easy mode (I think?) but I didn't try it so couldn't comment on what makes it easy. I played through on normal mode and personally had a blast. The music and visuals made the experience a joy!
Comet the Werefox	Recommended	38.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RileyHarrisGames/	Amazing soundtrack, the visuals are smooth and creative and the gameplay is even more so, the controls are accurate and it never feels unfair. A solid 9/10.
DarkHollow	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperion48/	Great game, nice music and art style! You can only love it! 10/10 Would buy it again
breadcrumbsnfish	Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198298767354/	Cuphead is a well thought out game and is one that i personally enjoyed for a number of reasons. When i bought this game i thought i was actually buying a game from the 1930s but it turns out they just made this game look like it was from the 1930s and actually it was made a few months ago. this rocked my world to the core. how could they make something look so realistic? as soon as i started playing this game i knew that this was gunna be a good game mannn. the best bit is the enemies in this game. you'll be surprised to see that most of these enemies are really dank memes. the memiest ones include the big blue circle that you have to fight at the start and the onion that you also have to fight at the start. pretty good game and it also has a dank side to it. definetely worth the money. GO BUY CUPHEAD!
What would The Omniscience do?	Recommended	8.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067935938/	Incredible art and audio, engaging combat, and challenging gameplay. This game really is a K N O C K O U T.
Splattak	Recommended	122.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198365416540/	This games art style, when you have the time to look at it, is incredible. No doubt about it. Now, the bosses are hard, but that sense of relief when you finally beat it is incredible. If you have a big problem with near to impossible games, the maybe not a buy, but this should definitely be a buy with out one. I really suck at games, and I've almost gotten 200% in this game.THis game needs to win a award in the upcoming Steam Awards 2017.
Feanominal	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Feanominal/	Simply Amazing! People cry and say it's "Hard" or "There should be an easy setting" ... ♥♥♥♥ THAT. This game is perfect just the way it is. If my wife and little sister, with no gaming experience, can come together and beat this game, then please tell me why I see all these "PROS" complaining           10/10  RQK APPROVED "Edit"Caused a meltdown on Thanksgiving 2017.. Worth every cent
Flip Z. Fox	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991372323/	Just when I thought Sonic Mania was the only true gem as of 2017, this made me guess again.The Contra-feel of the gameplay mixed in with the legitimately handdrawn and scanned drawings/backgrounds of each and every character, backdrop. animation, ect. is simply astounding. Not to mention this game really does reward those who are great at platformers and bullet hells alike and provides a really great challenge to everyone experienced enough in those categories. Not to mention, quite a lot of secrets are found within the gameplay as well as inspiration straight up from the 1930s cartoons themselves. This may have taken 4 painstaking years, but I can tell you much right now that it's entirely worth their time and effort as they put a lot of care into making it work. The bosses and levels the game provides are all unique and none of them feel repetitive or the same.I'm still playing the game whenever I can and I can tell you it's definitely worth buying. It's a legitimately good bullethell/tough-as-nails platformer.
rD_NickF	Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rD_NickF/	worth the wait.Damn...I f%#@ing love this game
Solreth	Recommended	281.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001284569/	My game of the Year
yashendra2797	Recommended	3.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yashendra2797/	This game is frustrating, punishing, and brutal. While its often compared to Dark Souls, the cheery atmosphere and top notch art style makes you feel♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at yourself than at the game. No matter how many times you die, you wanna restart it because you know you can do better. You KNOW it.
Fear	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/forbiddenfear/	Very addictive and challenging game, lots of fun and great music.Reminded me of Mickey's Wild Adventure on PS1 and took me a few years back. I had to readjust the controls cause they seemed a bit off for me, but overall 10/10 on it's kind.
Grundolf	Recommended	19.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198160654457/	good music, fun
B16B34R	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046128011/	This game is one of the most talked about games of the year. I am certain that you have heard or read about this game. If you haven't, you have been living under a rock. Considering its fame - or some would argue, infamy - my review of Cuphead will without a doubt drown in a sea of others. So I write this out of pure formality, and if nothing else than to confirm what you already know. Let me say that the stories are true; Cuphead is one for the record books. This will go down as one of the most heroic genre revivals in gaming history. Also, it has local co-op all the way through the campaign, which is the only reason I'm reviewing this. Be warned, do NOT attempt this game unless you are in a happy, fulfilling relationship. This will test your patience. The result of a drunk one night stand between Walt Disney and Metal Slug97/100
nzusty	Recommended	5.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nzusty/	The visuals and audio were enough to sell me on this one, but the satisfying challenging gameplay is what has been keeping me around. I've never really been one to play 'difficult' games, but Cuphead has me sitting here replaying the same boss multiple times to beat it and not hesitating to restart and get a little farther that last time. When you finally beat one it is so satisfying and then I'm determined to beat it again and try to get a higher grade. Cuphead is a great game and at only $20 its a steal considering how much time the developers put into hand drawing the animations and the great gameplay that goes along with it!

FreedomMiner285	Recommended	30.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198390192541/	This game is amazing! The hand drawn artstyle, the insane difficulty, the music, and everything else! I can see this game has gotten lots of inspiration from 1930 cartoons. One problem that should be fixed is whenever I try to open the game, it either plays the game normally or it crashes with a microsoft message saying that "cuphead.exe" won't open and load. Then it says it will notify me if there is a solution. Using the Steam version and playing on a laptop makes it worse. This really needs to be fixed. Overall, it's an awesome game! Thank you, MDHR Studios! And try to fix the problem, please! Also, Merry Christmas!
phearbot	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/phearbot/	Best game I picked up in 2017. I've paid a whole lot more for a whole lot less before. It's obviously difficult, but that's what makes it fun. Worth every penny.

𝕟𝕦𝕔𝕝𝕖𝕒𝕣 𝕕𝕙𝕒𝕣𝕞𝕚𝕤𝕥	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041596430/	Absolutely fantastic game all round- the art style / development techniques, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the narrative, all of it! However, there is one boss, which is fundamentaly flawed due to a number of factors, that I think should be redesigned. This is the Honeycomb Herald.To start, the fight is a vertical autoscroller; this in itself is already a poor design choice as the standard monitor's aspect ratio obviously favours the horizontal- allowing for time to see incoming projectiles and react accordingly as the screen forces you along. When it's vertical, however, there is little to no time to react, especially when sprites fly at you from out of view thanks to this orientation and can often just hit you after being on the screen for less than half a second.Secondly, dealing with platforms in a fluid and responsive manner (moving between both up and down) has always been a problem in platformers. When this is made even more difficult by the RNG of platform placement while the game is forcing you upwards, and there isn't sufficient vertical screen space to see if there will be platforms or not, it just makes for an annoying experience that is nigh-on impossible for the player to navigate around tactically without just a good pattern from luck.The RNG of the projectiles / enemies in combination with all this just makes for a complete mess.Overall, all of these aspects made this boss fight straight up un-fun. Unlike other bosses where they were frustrating, but the fault was entirely down to player error and the fights themselves were still enjoyable, as well as rewarding when beaten. Again, fantastic game all round, but that one boss was an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise incredible experience.
Irhlix	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Irhlix/	Overall, the game has been a mass appeal to me. The style of the animation, the gameplay, the mechanics and the difficulty have had contributed to the share of nostalgia that hit me. The game has simple mechanics, yet hard to master. The difficulty of the overall bosses aren't too bad as long as you have patience to take the time to get their attack patterns since it changes based on phases. Even then, every now and then you will get a bit annoyed. But that simply adds on to the relief felt after beating a boss that you have been stuck on.
Flip Z. Fox	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991372323/	Just when I thought Sonic Mania was the only true gem as of 2017, this made me guess again.The Contra-feel of the gameplay mixed in with the legitimately handdrawn and scanned drawings/backgrounds of each and every character, backdrop. animation, ect. is simply astounding. Not to mention this game really does reward those who are great at platformers and bullet hells alike and provides a really great challenge to everyone experienced enough in those categories. Not to mention, quite a lot of secrets are found within the gameplay as well as inspiration straight up from the 1930s cartoons themselves. This may have taken 4 painstaking years, but I can tell you much right now that it's entirely worth their time and effort as they put a lot of care into making it work. The bosses and levels the game provides are all unique and none of them feel repetitive or the same.I'm still playing the game whenever I can and I can tell you it's definitely worth buying. It's a legitimately good bullethell/tough-as-nails platformer.
Matterhorn	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MWoomer/	If your here not just for gameplay, but also the incredible 30`s cartoon animation and the great soundtrack you have come to the right place
swagmasterdoritos	Recommended	22.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/swagmasterdoritos/	Cuphead is as addictive as it is difficult as it is gorgeous looking/sounding. I can't recommend any game more, best 20 dollars I have ever spent hands down.
Cyclops	Recommended	34.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAmazingOneEye/	Cuphead is a blast from the past, delivering as one of the best games in 2017.THE GOOD:-This game is stunningly beautiful. I can't even stress enough how amazing the artwork in this game is. It's honestly even more incredible when you realize that each frame was drawn by hand.-The score of this game is just as amazing as the artwork. Each piece of music was originally composed for this game.-There is a vast array of weapons in this game.-Many of the boss fights and run & gun levels are just flat-out fun as hell, specifically King Dice. I find myself enjoying the gimmicks of a lot of the different levels in this game.-There are plenty of hidden shortcuts, miniature Easter eggs, and coins placed throughout the 4 worlds.THE BAD:-This game is EXTREMELY difficult, and I think that's been stressed enough in these reviews. But to put it simply, a few of the bosses in this game are overly difficult and unfair. (Take for instance Grim Matchstick, or his final form specifically. Or even Beppi the Clown.)-I found parrying to be a bit dreadful at times. Given that you have a very small time window to execute a parry, it's very easy to get damaged and be forced to redo an entire level because of a jump made too early, or a parry attempted to early.Overall, if you know what you're getting into (as far as difficulty goes), Cuphead is a very enjoyable game that is absolutely worth the $20 pricetag. The retry button will be your 2nd best friend after Mugman, and be prepared to smash your head into the keyboard many a times in this experience.9/10

HighHorizons	Recommended	16.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137007807/	YOU KNOW WHAT GAME THIS IS STOP READING AND BUY IT!!!
Praga da duna	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuinhaGamer/	Cuphead is a challenging platformer that aims for an old style both on gameplay and on visuals, you see, the art style of this game is simply amazing, but I guess you have already heard of it's 50's cartoon style, after all, it's the main reason people get interested in it, I believe, but don't get me wrong, it's not your everyday mario but with an awesome art style, the gameplay is totally about learning the enemies's patterns, because of that people most judge it as an insanely hard game or even the "2d dark souls", it's not that hard, you just got to learn the patterns by the trial and error strategy. The game has a big focus on the boss fights, but it does have normal platforming levels too.So basically, Cuphead has a fun, challenging gameplay and an incredible atmosphere, and I would totally recommend it to you, mainly if you're into this animation style. However, I can't recommend it fully to you if you're too inpatient or just extremely bad at skill based games, because you will mostly have a very hard and frustrating time, however, that was not the case for me and I can say I had a great time with this game, so yeah, I recommend it

Zeon	Recommended	50.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/weird-kid/	Cuphead has to be the best hardest game with the 60's (I assume) theme, which makes it unique. It has amazing bosses related to the theme, and a unique game mode, the Run & Gun. I do reccomend this, but not for the faint of heart, or rage. 8/10 (-2 based on my skill. Sorry!)
YagamiBrando	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/	Run and Gun at its best. Cuphead is a must if you like games like Contra, Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier.Lots of bosses, stunning visual style paying tribute to 30's cartoons, nice soundtrack and couch coop. What else to be desired?The game is challenging but fair, with a bit of practice you will best it. In the end it comes to pattern memorising and reaction, just like in old good contra games.10 out of 10 so far.

AvoTajo	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198191413065/	This game is a masterpiece, it tastes as good as a grain wave. It is fully hand drawn by two borthers who are PURE GENIUSES  they should make more like this otherwise I will become a mac gamer. I would give this game a 10/10 and if you do not own it, then go find your dads wallet take out a twenty and buy this legendary masterpiece they call CUPHEAD. You will need to edit the controls for keyboard because they taste like gluten free food EEEEEWWWWWW! Maybe if they could add some more players other than CUPHEAD and MUGMAN that would make the masterpiece 11/10. I think that the soundtrack is SO GOOD that it makes you want to call your grandma and tell her how great it is. At the moment I only have 6 hours in a few minutes I'll have over 1000 hours. So now to finish of the review I will say one word "buy this game". Subscribe to me on youtube to watch me play the game, my channel name is AvoTajo. the videos are coming soon but are not out yet, believe in me and I'll give you a free kitten in the mail.
Beamex	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Beamex/	This is a difficult game to recommend to just anyone, and there are a few things you should consider before you drop $20 on this beautifully animated and composed platformer. First thing to mention is it is rediculously hard. A player of average skill will struggle with the first few stages of this game, and if you don't handle repetitive deaths well and starting from the beggining each time, then you will want to reconsider buying this. If you are below average at games, or just platformers in general, you'll for sure want to look elsewhere as you simple will not get much value for your money.Second thing needed to know is it is "heavily focused on boss-battles" according to the steam description. I feel more needs to be said about this because it's pretty much a boss-battle game, with a very small amount of platformer levels throw in. Essentially you begin a majority of level fighting the boss and that's it. If you're expecting something like Megaman, this is not that.After all that being said, if you're still interested, then I recommend you buy this game. It brings the same sort of challenge you would expect from games like Wings of Vii, IWBTG, and Boshy. All the bosses are very unique and bring new challenges, and the controls are spot on. The parry system takes some getting used to but is very fun to use and feels great when you land them properly. There is a rating system which brings simple, classic replayability that old school gamers will enjoy, aswell as 2 player coop.My only complaint so far is how the difficulty scaled during my normal playthrough. I found that the difficulty went up very sharp towards the end of world 2, which is ok, but it dropped off at the end of world 3 and all the way towards the end of the game. Based on some world 2 bosses taking me an hour+ to beat I was expecting the final few bosses to take me days to beat, but instead they took me maybe 20 minuites each. I'm hoping expert difficulty is different.Super fun game though.
B16B34R	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046128011/	This game is one of the most talked about games of the year. I am certain that you have heard or read about this game. If you haven't, you have been living under a rock. Considering its fame - or some would argue, infamy - my review of Cuphead will without a doubt drown in a sea of others. So I write this out of pure formality, and if nothing else than to confirm what you already know. Let me say that the stories are true; Cuphead is one for the record books. This will go down as one of the most heroic genre revivals in gaming history. Also, it has local co-op all the way through the campaign, which is the only reason I'm reviewing this. Be warned, do NOT attempt this game unless you are in a happy, fulfilling relationship. This will test your patience. The result of a drunk one night stand between Walt Disney and Metal Slug97/100

OReach	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013426446/	Fantastic game.I wouldn't compare it to many other games though. I've seen comparisons to mega man or dark souls etc. No. Not at all. You might be able compare it to Dark souls if you remove everything from Dark souls other than the bosses.Platforming levels take the back seat here, do NOT buy this game for the level design. They're sadly few in number. The focus of this game is entirely on the boss fights, and while fun, I do wish there were more regular stages. Boss fights outnumber stages 3 to 1. This is my one major complaint.The difficulty is on point. This game is not nearly as hard as other games known for their difficulty (Dark souls,  super meatboy etc). Anyone used to playing difficult platformers won't find this game difficult. With that said, it's not an easy game, so don't expect to beat the bosses first try. The boss designs are well thought out and generally quite fair and fun to play.Overall, this is a must buy if you like 2d games with a challenge and are interested in a focus on boss fights. It's worth the money.

apollo	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/apollodw/	stupid game
wottermelon	Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wottermelon/	First off, Cuphead is a gorgeous game with an authentic soundtrack that somehow doesn't get old the 40th time you reset a boss fight. The mechanics are pretty simple and never require you to do much more than memorize a boss' patterns as first encounters will often result in quick deaths upon phase changes.One area that doesn't quite work perfectly is the shmup shooting sections. The bosses are all fun and frantic, but having things fly by in the foreground obscuring your view of projectiles is a big no-no. Also, projectiles spawning in from off-screen, such as Dr. Kahl and his robot, seems somewhat unfair.Unfortunately for my taste, luck plays an all-too-important role in some boss encounters where certain patterns will just require you to take a hit without much to do about it on your part. And with a default of 3HP in a fight (and no way to heal during a fight), a bad pattern almost always results in a death or a reset.That being said, the bosses are wonderfully unique, creatively designed, and all very impressively put together. Each fight has its quirks and they all work together to flesh out the running and shooting. My favorite would have to be the first boss in the last area, with a sampling of 9 mini-bosses before the final encounter, it's a neat encounter that adheres strikingly well to its theme.I've gone through and done everything except beat the game on expert because even I have my limits, but I'm very glad to have picked up this game! It lived up to the hype!
mathead	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mathead/	Are you stressed out, miserable or frustrated? Well not quite enough until you played this game. Get yourself stuck in a swing-era cartoon nightmare that will put you in your place and show you who's boss. You like video games? Well you do you like them now that they're twisting your arms and poking your eye while whistling a Duke Ellington tune. This game is the worst. I hate it! No, seriously, it's absolutely great.

TheFlyingDragon	Recommended	38.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320205027/	Cuphead is a great example of craft and care. From the tigth controls to fantastic style, Cuphead has it all.Gameplay - Gameplay in Cuphead is pure joy. The controls felt great to play with, parry was a little tricky to learn, but overall the are easy to pickup. The battles are challenging but fair, making you determined to beat one boss just so you can beat another. While the game is hard it never makes you want to give up. Instead it entices you with the challenge and urges you to continue. This combined with the controls creates a wonderful experience.Design - The world is simple with four distinct sections that provide a hub to contain each boss and level. While simple it doesn't get in the way and serves its purpose well. While there only a few levels each one is different with its own elements, enemies, and challenges. The levels are built well and are entertaining to play. However the highlight of the game is not the levels but the bosses. Each one is unique and memorable, with great desgins and themes the bosses are brilliantly designed. The menus and layout is simple and easy to use, giving you everything you need. Most of the items are useful with only one or two that felt unnecessary. But overall the game is designed incredibly well.Aesthetic - What can be said that hasn't already but said before, the game is beautiful. The animation is wonderful to watch, the backgrounds are great, and the music is fantastic. Every element is perfect and provides a sense of awe and wonder.Story - The story is basic and that is the point. It gives reason to the madness, and doesn't get in the way. Nothing bad because there is nothing that can be bad.Experience - Overall the game's atmosphere is so enticing that it always leaves you wanting more. The gameplay and style tie together brilliantly and create such a satisfying experience. The difficulty builds quickly but it is never overwhelming. As a single item it succeeds in every element that brings to the table.Overall - Cuphead is easily one of the best games of 2017, and one of the best of all time. While hard it is fair, and its charm is undeniable. A truly wonderful experience-10/10

jetjet	Recommended	11.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jettylovefield/	Quite a game. It is challenging but not borderline impossible or "as hard as people make it". Let's put the bad parts already: the gun' n run levels are not good. As always, not impossible or whatsoever but they're just there to give you a reason to get coins or some no damage run. Majority of bosses are amazing on their own, sadly a very few are questionable at best. Parries can't be consistent but luckily there's a Charm that helps you with that.  That's it for negative look.Game has amazing visuals, music and all. Bosses are memorable and have their own amazing animation and game over quotes. It's also a good way to relieve the 1930s.Don't be afraid of using Simple mode despite having some phases cut, a good side of Simple mode is being able to unlock the roads faster and learning the patterns of said phases. When you feel you can do better, Regular mode all the way.
foo/	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976221465/	It's horrendously hard. I love it.
MegaJAw	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/scottjaw/	This is one of the prettiest games EVER! Good thing it looks so nice because you'll want to smash your face against your monitor after playing it. 10/10
FILMNOIZE	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/filmnoize/	After fifteen minutes of Cuphead you will probably no longer be admitted to heaven, but I can assure you that it's worth it. Best swear simulator around here, with an incredible art direction.
HunterXCooL	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hunterxcool/	This game is freaking epic... I need more of this fantastic experience playing thisPROS :Very unique bosses that is hard to beat and fun to replay over and over and over again... Every time you died you're gonna say "ONE MORE" lol...The feeling you get when you finally see the "Knockout" word at the boss that's been pounding you over and over again is extraordinary LOL... you will probably laugh and scream with joy... We did :)The devil is not to be underestimated with... It actually the only boss that makes my blood boil... and the feeling when we actually beat the crap out of him can't be described properly LOL Co-op is FUN AS HELL... you will laugh, scream, yell, swear and cry at your friend ROTFL... it's an emotional roller coaster to begin withCONS :I bought this game because so many people saying that it's "HARD" but TBH the bosses are not as hard as my expectation just challenging enough to be fun... The devil is the only exception though LOL...Please scroll up and buy the game... It's not that pricey for this amazing game
Ziberian	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziberian/	Great game. Really unique bosses/levels with tons of fun! Important Note:There is an issue where sometimes you open the game and your save files are completely wiped (happened to me after electricity went out), so I highly suggest not rage quitting with ALT + F4 or anything.
cardiovascular disaster	Recommended	45.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bobertulus/	good
Ceo of Thicc Nibbas Inc.	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198345888703/	This game is very challenging for anyone that has the nerves not to rage quit after losing on the second level (like I have). The keyboard key binds are garbo so I recommend changing them, although a controller would be ideal. I love the graphics and its the little things that make a game great such as every time you die the music slows. If you do the little things right, the big things take care of themselves.
Commie	Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iCommie/	Cuphead is a type of game that has a certain difficulty that can easily be overcome after a couple tries.It teaches the player to learn from their mistakes and avoid them to achieve victory. A lesson a lot of people can learn in life. Cuphead has a very well made, fluid, and unique animation style which almost brings a nostalgic feeling to it. As of gameplay, it doesn't walk your hand through anything or give you the choice to skip a couple of bosses because it's "too hard". It shows you to have fun and not to take the game seriously. It teaches you to take thing slow and really enjoy the game for what it is. I personally rate this a 9/10, one of the best games I've seen all year.
wasabidög	Recommended	60.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156151336/	Instant classic. Cuphead is one of my favourite games in recent memory, and we've had a good few years. Just buy it, and make sure it's not on sale, the devs deserve every last penny.

Max	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iTasticc/	I have yet to finish this game, and when I do I'll re-write this review, but so far, it's amazing. Although it is easy to get frustrated, the rewarding feeling you get once you pass a level completely makes up for the effort you have to put in. Along with that, the soundtrack and visuals are outstanding and go hand in hand to make the whole experience so much better. I can't wait to play more.

KumquatHead	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122634064/	Aesthetically beautiful, but its difficulty gets really annoying after some time, especially if you're playing local co-op.
Xuchilbara	Recommended	63.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ryukthecreep/	Cuphead is a great game, a wonderful piece of handwork and a great homage to old-school gaming. It delivers a fun, demanding yet rewarding experience that cannot leave anybody indifferent thanks to its amazing art direction, animation and exquisite soundtrack. So it's all good, right? Well, not really...Lemme say that Cuphead's gameplay is very solid and the way it has been filled with references and homages to old classic games - like Super Mario, Megaman and Contra - is further proof that the developers know well what good game design is about. However, there are some flaws here and there that can be quite annoying, especially if you're trying to get perfect ranks. For instance, some levels like Perilous Pliers or bosses like Beppi the Clown involve a significant amount of randomness in attack patterns, which can often lead to situations where is nearly impossible to avoid getting hit. Another problem can be found in the way certain elements in the foreground are placed, which sometimes partially obscure visuals thus creating an utterly artificial and obnoxious obstacle for the player. Level and boss design is generally good, sometimes remarkable, aside for one big exception: Rumor Honeybottoms (aka the honeycomb boss). A vertical scrolling level where you are constantly being forced to jump off-screen and where 90% of the times you get hit are from something you cannot see, is just something I didn't want to find in a modern game. Especially not in a game like this.A minor complaint I have is about the "Simple" difficulty: personally I don't care about it because I always play levels on Regular or Expert, but from what I saw it seems rather pointless since you can beat bosses but it doesn't count them on your list, thus preventing you from finishing the game. I think that's just unfair for many people that want to try an accessible mode but ultimately find themselves cut off near the finishing line. If you want to include an easier difficulty you either do it properly or you don't do it at all.Another minor thing that bugs me is about the "Pacifist" rank in run n' gun levels: I think that there should have been separate rankings for completing a level with an A+ and for completing it with a P. As it is, the game considers the P ranking the highest so it's pretty useless to sweat your♥♥♥♥♥trying to get an A+ when you can just go straight for a pacifist run. That's rather nonsensical since when you're doing a pacifist run you don't have to worry about time, damage or parrys, hence it's much easier to do so than to make a perfect run.Finally, bugs: there are quite a few as you can see from the discussion thread in the forums, but I personally never found gamebreaking ones. The fact that there hasn't been a single patch since the release is not comforting though, and I hope that the devs will fix some issues that are currently preventing some people from playing the game.To conclude, I know I might sound quite critical in this review, but believe me when I say that this game is absolutely amazing and that I love it with passion. It's exactly for this reason that I wanted to highlight its weak points instead of just praising it, 'cause I think that StudioMDHR guys have the potential to make even more amazing games in the future and I really want them to learn from their (overall few) errors. That said, I highly recommend everyone to play this gem, enjoy it and let yourself be amazed by the crazy world of Cuphead - even if that means you'll have to swear to your monitor a bit. It will be worth your while.

What would The Omniscience do?	Recommended	8.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067935938/	Incredible art and audio, engaging combat, and challenging gameplay. This game really is a K N O C K O U T.
Splattak	Recommended	122.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198365416540/	This games art style, when you have the time to look at it, is incredible. No doubt about it. Now, the bosses are hard, but that sense of relief when you finally beat it is incredible. If you have a big problem with near to impossible games, the maybe not a buy, but this should definitely be a buy with out one. I really suck at games, and I've almost gotten 200% in this game.THis game needs to win a award in the upcoming Steam Awards 2017.

breadcrumbsnfish	Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198298767354/	Cuphead is a well thought out game and is one that i personally enjoyed for a number of reasons. When i bought this game i thought i was actually buying a game from the 1930s but it turns out they just made this game look like it was from the 1930s and actually it was made a few months ago. this rocked my world to the core. how could they make something look so realistic? as soon as i started playing this game i knew that this was gunna be a good game mannn. the best bit is the enemies in this game. you'll be surprised to see that most of these enemies are really dank memes. the memiest ones include the big blue circle that you have to fight at the start and the onion that you also have to fight at the start. pretty good game and it also has a dank side to it. definetely worth the money. GO BUY CUPHEAD!
GravityGem	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GravityGem/	Cuphead is a great game however it's hard to actually call this game a platformer as there is little to no platforming involved. If I could call this game anything it would be a bullet hell boss rushdown. It should come as no surprise that the game takes pride in the bosses as it's the one thing the game does best and is the best part about the game. However as for the actual "levels" they feel rushed and last minute. overall I think this game was great and I enjoyed every second and every frame. If you're up for a challenge and love bosses then this game is definitely for you.Good luck getting past the tutorial

thenackmeister	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nackfinch/	This game is amazing. Loving the visual art style, its so complex and greatly animated, and it runs great on my subpar laptop to my surprise. Note though, the difficulty is HARD. Even on a 'Simple' mode for your levels, you'll still be raging after your 50th death. But when you win. Oh man.
Akuma's Brother, Dennis	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990158622/	This has been quite possibly the most visually appealing and most fun to play game I've played since The Witcher 3. Not too hard, but not easy. Fast paced gameplay a la Gunstar Heroes. Max Fleischer esque art style that has every frame hand drawn, and not fanservicey, unlike Skullgirls. An easy contender for my GOTY 2017. A must have.
quack.quack.bloobloo	Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164387651/	Its a platformer where you need to listen to audio and visual cues for incoming attacks. Dying for first few rounds is a part of  the game because you need to learn these cues for every boss. When you die it shows you far you were from finishing the boss. Whether or not this game will be difficult for you depends on how good you are at reading the cues and remembering sequences of attacks. Tip for begginers for buying a starting attack:  at your first shop there is a close range red attack on sale which shoots in multiple directions and basically acts like a shotgun. This will help lower the boss's health much faster and also easily counter homing projectiles.

AvoTajo	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198191413065/	This game is a masterpiece, it tastes as good as a grain wave. It is fully hand drawn by two borthers who are PURE GENIUSES  they should make more like this otherwise I will become a mac gamer. I would give this game a 10/10 and if you do not own it, then go find your dads wallet take out a twenty and buy this legendary masterpiece they call CUPHEAD. You will need to edit the controls for keyboard because they taste like gluten free food EEEEEWWWWWW! Maybe if they could add some more players other than CUPHEAD and MUGMAN that would make the masterpiece 11/10. I think that the soundtrack is SO GOOD that it makes you want to call your grandma and tell her how great it is. At the moment I only have 6 hours in a few minutes I'll have over 1000 hours. So now to finish of the review I will say one word "buy this game". Subscribe to me on youtube to watch me play the game, my channel name is AvoTajo. the videos are coming soon but are not out yet, believe in me and I'll give you a free kitten in the mail.
Beamex	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Beamex/	This is a difficult game to recommend to just anyone, and there are a few things you should consider before you drop $20 on this beautifully animated and composed platformer. First thing to mention is it is rediculously hard. A player of average skill will struggle with the first few stages of this game, and if you don't handle repetitive deaths well and starting from the beggining each time, then you will want to reconsider buying this. If you are below average at games, or just platformers in general, you'll for sure want to look elsewhere as you simple will not get much value for your money.Second thing needed to know is it is "heavily focused on boss-battles" according to the steam description. I feel more needs to be said about this because it's pretty much a boss-battle game, with a very small amount of platformer levels throw in. Essentially you begin a majority of level fighting the boss and that's it. If you're expecting something like Megaman, this is not that.After all that being said, if you're still interested, then I recommend you buy this game. It brings the same sort of challenge you would expect from games like Wings of Vii, IWBTG, and Boshy. All the bosses are very unique and bring new challenges, and the controls are spot on. The parry system takes some getting used to but is very fun to use and feels great when you land them properly. There is a rating system which brings simple, classic replayability that old school gamers will enjoy, aswell as 2 player coop.My only complaint so far is how the difficulty scaled during my normal playthrough. I found that the difficulty went up very sharp towards the end of world 2, which is ok, but it dropped off at the end of world 3 and all the way towards the end of the game. Based on some world 2 bosses taking me an hour+ to beat I was expecting the final few bosses to take me days to beat, but instead they took me maybe 20 minuites each. I'm hoping expert difficulty is different.Super fun game though.

It's a beautiful work of animation art.The music was entertaining. The only thing I don't like is dying in any difficult level because it's frustrating. Other than that, I really enjoyed the game.

Bill_4780	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/William_4780/	Basically the Dark Souls of 2D games.The game is difficult, yes, but it's worth it since it has great well animated visuals and smooth responsive controls, it is also accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of the old cartoons that really hooks you up from the start.So if you're a fan of challenging platformers you should check it out.

nick	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/9071770/	Cuphead is a hand-drawn side scroller shooter which plays just like the classics. You need to learn the levels and patterns before you can beat them and eventually you can master fights that you once thought difficult. The game also has an incredible soundtrack which I recommend you purchase because it comes with well over 50 tracks. I only wish the game had online co-op from launch and also wish you could bind things to your mouse. I played through the entire game on keyboard so if you don't own a controller no need to worry because you can complete it the classic way.I recommend you pick this title up, it's not something you want to miss out on.

Tip for begginers for buying a starting attack:  at your first shop there is a close range red attack on sale which shoots in multiple directions and basically acts like a shotgun. This will help lower the boss's health much faster and also easily counter homing projectiles.

LSD	Recommended	49.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356495165/	I thought this game looked cool and saw it was on sale so I bought it. Little did I know this game would consume me. This game will have you thinking that there is nothing you can do to gain the upperhand. Which makes it sweeter when you do beat them. Challenging but fair. If you are looking for a game that looks great, sounds great, feels great, and makes you feel helpless yet powerful Cuphead is for you. It is one of the best games I have been fortunite enough to play and is a game I am proud to say I beat.
Spyder	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963882586/	The quality in presentation is worth it alone, good thing there's a real game underneath for me to recommend it anyway. You won't be seeing graphics like this soon again even with Cuphead's recent success, so enjoy it.
PsychoCat 猫	Recommended	23.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/psychocatx/	This game will make you hate every single boss in it...  every single boss But it's fun with friends!

NinjaHawk	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjahawk44/	From the phenomenal art, to the exciting, yet challenging boss fights. Cuphead is an amazing game and completely worth getting.Lived up to all hype and exceeded it.
Matterhorn	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MWoomer/	If your here not just for gameplay, but also the incredible 30`s cartoon animation and the great soundtrack you have come to the right place
Thatguy	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatguyplayingames/	Difficult but in a fair way. Art style is amazing and quirky. And if ya like jazz then the OST should go strait to your Ipod.
keff 👌	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kf91/	"In an era where microtransactions, unfinished products, and ridiculous crowd-sourced titles rule the video game landscape, it’s always refreshing to see an indie-title that throws all the corporate gibberish out the door and release a fun, complete product. It’s even more satisfying to see all the effort and polish that went into something that’s nothing short of a visual and auditory masterpiece."Full review: https://viewportgaming.com/cuphead-review-d62d57ce5528/ 
Era un om pe nume Ion	Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SM-47/	Soooo nostalgic! I remember watching as a kid cartoons from 30s and 40s!
xDickey	Recommended	29.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xDickey/	You play as a cup. You dodge stuff and slap some pink things around. Its hard but you adapt and learn to win. Highly recommended
Dr. Spagooter	Recommended	12.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr_Spagooter/	The whole art style in this game, and the fact that it's hard as hell convinced me enough to steal a few welfare checks and use it to spend it on this.  I feel like I put those checks into charity of something that's important in life (like my bills which I should really be paying for).  I really enjoy the art style, and I really find it stunning the devs actually handrawn the animation like people in the 1930s would back then(since the fact that's what the game was suppose to feel like). I also like the fact it's hard, but not "hard", to the point where you either barely or don't make any progress(even though I'm currently at world two despite writing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review).  It's just a learning curve with each boss on how beat them, and be able to figure out what the hell you're suppose to do to not get demolished in your no-death/no damage run.  Thought the tutorial.................was not that hard at all dean you god damn "journalist" I never managed to get very angry in this game knowing it's hard.  Though,  If you tend to break a few monitors, a controller, a headset, a few keyboards, and/or break a mouse (that's already screwed) over a tough game like this, then please prevent abuse for electronics and don't buy this game.Otherwise, please help out these poor devs pay rent, and spend those sweet welfare checks to these guys.please :(
The IT Guy	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iseeingi2i/	The Dark Souls of 2D shooters ~ IGN (yes really)That being said this is a fantastic game, all hand drawn art, masterfully composed soundtrack, the right amount of upgrades and secrets, a mostly fair difficulty curve. Seriously buy this now. 10.5/10 Was the best gaming experience this year.
gh0st.//proxy	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158650228/	The single greatest test of patience since girlfriends were invented. You will die. A lot. And invent new swear words on the way, but by the time you reach the final boss, your thumbs will be more toned than Schwarzenegger's arms in his prime. Play, die, git gud, repeat - welcome to Cuphead, rookie.

TMAC Blade	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/seriousdude/	For a game that has its roots in contra and an art style more akeen to that of a bug bunny cartoon, it can only be described as weird twisted and utterly mangled.....but in a good way. the cartoon art style brings back many memories of bugs bunny but at the same time it reminds me of the days i played contra on the nes, snes and sega genesis. It brings a lot of nostolgia to the table and does it in the best way imanginable.  The only gripe some people have is the difficulty, but personally i don't see it being a problem. If you aren't willing to take the time and learn the paterns and weaknesses of each boss then you aren't playing the game right.
jmvizanko	Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982828746/	I should hate this game.  It should be something I refunded after 20 minutes.  I hate super difficult games.  I refund many games in under an hour because of their difficulty.  I love platformers, and they are maybe my favorite genre next to puzzle games, but I haaaaate the bosses.  I have played entire games only to not finish them because I didn’t want to finish the final boss.This game is amazing!  Every boss demands new thinking, new strategy, new management of weapons and abilities, and a new test of patience and wishing to whatever gods you worship for a lucky run.  Including resets because of an early fatal flaw, I probably attempted to defeat the dragon over 200 times.  I changed weapons, bought new upgrades, and changed strategies numerous times.  Yet I never rage-quitted.  I just wanted back at another chance again and again.Why if I hate bosses, and I love platformers, would I love a game that is only a platformer in order to play bosses?  Because the bosses in this game are so varied and complex that they each present a new puzzle of strategy and gameplay to defeat, that to call them traditional bosses is an insult to the design.  Maybe that and the fact you know that that is entirely what you are signing up for?  But absolutely everything else is executed with such love and detail that you are enticed to experience more of the game.  The graphics are gorgeous and unique.  The soundtrack (so perfect) and sound effects are amazing, and I wish I had purchased the version with the soundtrack.  The game may have been in a mini version of development hell for a long time, but you can tell it is only because the developers wanted it to be pristine.  That it is.Only the run and gun levels seem a bit out of place.  But even they are still fun challenges, and just as challenging indeed.  This game gets a 10/10 from me, a player who hates bosses yet can't wait to finish every boss in this game (I'm almost there).  If this game even remotely seems like something you would enjoy, just scroll up and buy it. 
Africa by toto	Recommended	133.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198213536973/	I absolutly love this game well worth thr wait but the only problem I have with the game is the bosses like the dragon he took me an hour to beat Just a little suggestion that maybe you could put lives spmewhere around the run & gun levels overall nice job with the art style!
The Third Child	Recommended	33.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thethirdchild95/	I'm gonna say it. Cuphead is definitely a harder game then Dark Souls III. This game will have you grinding so much. When you think you've faced the hardest boss, it throws another seemingly impossible one at you. This game is a must buy for anyone who likes a challenge in video games. So fun too, I love the artstlyle especially and the music and look fit the time well that it's trying to establish. 9/10. My only gripe with this game is that there is no online multiplayer and that it is only split screen. Other than that I couldn't have asked for a better game this year. My GOTY for sure. Get it especially if it is on sale, but this game deserves all your money

But don't be fooled by the cute 1930's style graphics this game is HARD!!! It will make you want to throw your key board at the wall and punch your moniter! 
Chexryukika ♥	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Glubbys_Profile/	Very fun game and not that hard on a keyboard too, just confusing at the begining, adding Online Co-op would be pretty cool!
TheFlyingDragon	Recommended	38.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320205027/	Cuphead is a great example of craft and care. From the tigth controls to fantastic style, Cuphead has it all.Gameplay - Gameplay in Cuphead is pure joy. The controls felt great to play with, parry was a little tricky to learn, but overall the are easy to pickup. The battles are challenging but fair, making you determined to beat one boss just so you can beat another. While the game is hard it never makes you want to give up. Instead it entices you with the challenge and urges you to continue. This combined with the controls creates a wonderful experience.Design - The world is simple with four distinct sections that provide a hub to contain each boss and level. While simple it doesn't get in the way and serves its purpose well. While there only a few levels each one is different with its own elements, enemies, and challenges. The levels are built well and are entertaining to play. However the highlight of the game is not the levels but the bosses. Each one is unique and memorable, with great desgins and themes the bosses are brilliantly designed. The menus and layout is simple and easy to use, giving you everything you need. Most of the items are useful with only one or two that felt unnecessary. But overall the game is designed incredibly well.Aesthetic - What can be said that hasn't already but said before, the game is beautiful. The animation is wonderful to watch, the backgrounds are great, and the music is fantastic. Every element is perfect and provides a sense of awe and wonder.Story - The story is basic and that is the point. It gives reason to the madness, and doesn't get in the way. Nothing bad because there is nothing that can be bad.Experience - Overall the game's atmosphere is so enticing that it always leaves you wanting more. The gameplay and style tie together brilliantly and create such a satisfying experience. The difficulty builds quickly but it is never overwhelming. As a single item it succeeds in every element that brings to the table.Overall - Cuphead is easily one of the best games of 2017, and one of the best of all time. While hard it is fair, and its charm is undeniable. A truly wonderful experience-10/10

PowSyd_	Recommended	53.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdpo2511/	I've been playing Cuphead for a while now and I think it's time to write something about this amazing game.One of the reasons why I like this game so much is because of the graphics. These are based on the quality of the cartoons from the 30's and it works really good on the game. The other reason is the difficulty. If you've searched on this game or if you've already played it, then you know it's an INSANELY HARD GAME! If you like challenges, then you definitely need to play Cuphead.The gameplay is also great, but I recommend you to use a controller. I find it easier that way.I really enjoy playing this game and I recommend it very much.
hypercybermegatron	Recommended	80.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hypercybermegatron/	One of the most memorable, challenging, and fun games I've ever played in my life. I must stress that I was 100% keen for this game for a long time. However, I was never going to buy it if it had that rotten Denuvo crap, which is the devil's stinky excrement. Luckily, it doesn't!!!The game itself is grueling, but in the most delightful way. You will die many, many times. But if you're like me, you will find this entertaining. You will see some people complaining that it's to hard; I don't like this criticism!! It's sad when Devs buckle under preassure from your Candy Crush sookie la-la type panzies asking to make the game a walk in the park. Brigador faced a lot of criticism for the game being to hard, now it's so ridiculously easy, it's not really fun. But Cuphead did not buckle under any talk of it being too hard, which is great! It's actually not really that hard, it just requires patience, but this trait is lacking in dimwitted people who want things quick and easy. At the end of the day, the difficulty of the game has been designed masterfully.The graphics are amazing. There's no other game that does what this game does graphically. I don't know why Disney isn't paying the devs $10 Billion to work on some games using a similar animation style. Overall, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game at full price!!

Take it away and you still have a fun 2D platformer boss rush game. If I had any complains, it would be the lack of run'n'gun levels in the finale. Other than that, the game is fantastic. A must buy for fans of run´n´gun games and boss rush games.Oh, and the music is freaking sweet. That's kinda important too.

SoWhat	Recommended	47.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198344071040/	Honestly i thought this was gonna be just terrible but it was better than i expected the jumping shooting parrying and the weapons are amazing. Even the art! Ive spent so many hours playing then i rage alot, But After i rage i learn from my mistakes and beat the boss! I would love to play with my other friend but he doesnt have enough storage :(. But, I would still reccomend this to a friend. $20 Well Spent.
The Schmoofy.tar[nom³]	Recommended	23.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Schmoofy/	After the long long wait for Cuphead, I can say with confidence even after only a few hours that this game is pure art. Being a large fan of the 1930s cartoon style, specifically Disney, it's a dream come true. From the moment the title sequence starts you feel taken backwards in time, down to the graininess of your entire screen.The game is unrelenting in difficulty, but that's not a bad thing being it forces you to learn the levels and take a specific approach to each one. Each boss has different moves making each battle unique enough to keep the game moving, but routine enough to learn and master a reaction. The hitboxes are EXACT and extremely fair.Should you buy this game because it was literally all hand-drawn in a depricated and classic art form frame by frame by frame? Should you buy this game because every inch of music was performed and recorded using period-piece instruments making an authentically sounding experience? Should you buy this game because $19.99 is an absolute steal? All of the above.Bravo Studio MDHR!

Living Joker	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995389078/	There's nothing I can say about this game that all the other steam reviews won't tell you, so I'll just got over the cliff's notes for you.Positives:Beautiful aesthetic that no other game has.Tight controls that mean, theoretically, all damage you take is your own fault.Challenging, almost punishing difficulty will test your patience but ultimately leave you with a sense of satisfaction.Levels are short so dying doesn't feel like that big a deal.Equipment, weapon, and super selection let you feel like you're not just playing as a specific archetype, and allow you to mix up combinations for different challenges if that's how you want to play the game.Megaman players will feel right at home with the Charge shot, knowing they need to pay attention to yet another layer of gameplay, the rhythm of charging up an attack, in order to gain a damage advantage. (If Charge is ever nerfed it will be worthless, since it is only better than other shots if you land its once-every-couple-seconds blast.)Negatives:Too many attacks don't give you any warning as to their area of effect until it occurs, making too many first tries only trial runs you know you'll fail on. (See the double flamethrower on Werner or the tugboat's chargin' mah lazor attacks for instance.)Chaser is both bad at chasing and bad at damage, and if you are even moderately skilled at moving and shooting, you'll always want the pea shooter instead for sustained rapid-fire damage.Some projectiles are difficult to see or approach from unexpected directions or far too quickly. (Bone wheel on the train boss, flames from said boss.)Unexpected interactions with various parryable items/creatures. The octopus for instance most players will assume would hurt to touch.Parrying objects above you feels off. When it's underneath you can tell when to press the button, but above it's almost like Cuphead's hitbox extends too far vertically to reliably parry anything with ensuring it will collide into you mid parry, instead of parrying as you collide into it.Short. My playtime as of my first complete Regular playthrough was 4.6 hours.Some weapons or items have limited or seemingly no worth. I used lobber once, on the bee, and didn't even need to.Scrolling in multiplayer run n' gun levels is awful, as if players are too far apart the player in the lead will often take damage before being able to dodge out of the way.All of this said, this is the first game I have paid full price for in a long time without feeling ripped off, and if you have any confidence in your hand-eye coordination I think you should give it a shot.Edit: As of the recent update supposedly the developer did indeed nerf Charge, as well as apply a few other nerfs to existing strategies. The ones which were clearly exploits like the switching weapon bug are fine, but some of them make the game a less interesting and less fun experience. This is still a thumbs up for me but less enthusiastically than before.
